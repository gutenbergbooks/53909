<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p>This little book is primarily intended for present
and past students of Newnham College and for the
numerous friends who have been helpers or sympathetic
spectators of its early progress. At the same
time I venture to hope that it may prove interesting
and suggestive to a wider circle of persons practically
or theoretically concerned in movements for the
higher education of women.</p>

<p>Of the deficiencies of this short history, no one
could be more fully aware than the writer herself.
But for the expressed wish of the Council of Newnham
College, it would never have been attempted, nor
could it have been written at all without the kind
co-operation of friends, who, like myself, had known
the College from the inside. I would especially
thank the present Principal, Miss B. A. Clough, and
the Registrar, Miss E. M. Sharpley, for supplying me
with information and with kindly criticisms throughout
my task. It has been gratifying to realize that
the Publisher is son of an early friend of the College.</p>

<p>One of the chief difficulties in writing the history
of a comparatively young institution, and one raised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
by the labours, forethought, and sacrifices of many
"pious founders and benefactors" is that the range
of view possible to any former student and teacher
must necessarily be limited. I have felt deep regret
in realizing how many honoured helpers have&mdash;for
lack of space&mdash;not even been mentioned. Similarly,
among the former students whose labours, scientific,
literary, and practical, have brought credit to the
College, I have necessarily shown most appreciation
of those with whose work and influence I have been
personally best acquainted. Every past student will
have to supplement the story with recollections from
her own experience.</p>

<p>I trust that, at least, I shall have brought home
to many the conviction that Newnham College is
unique, in the character and motives of its first
founders, in the steady devotion to its best interests
of successive governors, teachers and students, as
also in its relations&mdash;complicated, but near, we may
hope, to a solution&mdash;with the University under the
protecting shadow of which it has grown to prosperity.
My hope for this little work is that, besides
helping to justify the existence of the College in the
eyes of the world, it may in some measure preserve
in its members the knowledge of our best traditions
in the past and inspire a confident hope for the future.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I<br />

<span class="st">INTRODUCTORY. &nbsp; NEWNHAM COLLEGE IN IDEA</span></h2>


<p>In tracing the history of educational institutions
and of other foundations existing for the public
good, we find it necessary to distinguish those that
had and those that had not a definite beginning.
Some of our colleges and great schools have&mdash;so to
speak&mdash;sprung, adult and armed, from the brain
of their founder&mdash;or possibly from the conjoint
thoughts and efforts of a few generous and like-minded
patrons. Their birthdays are easily determined.
Their continuity can be traced both in
material persistence and progress and in moral
and intellectual development and adaptation to
changing conditions. Others&mdash;and prominent
among them the subject of this sketch&mdash;came into
being so gradually that their length of days may be
variously calculated. To the past students of
Newnham College, the beginning seems to be most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
naturally and fittingly associated with the day when
a comparatively small dwelling house was first
opened, in Cambridge, by Professor Sidgwick and a
small group of friends, and placed under the wise
and devoted care of Miss Clough, for the accommodation
of a few young women who wished to give their
time to serious study under the tuition of such
University professors, lecturers, and private teachers
as might be willing to further their desire for higher
education. Incorporation as a College was not to
come for nine years, nor any measure of distinct
recognition by the University for ten years. But no
Newnham woman would reckon our beginnings from
1880 or 1881. An antiquarian spirit might fancy
that the germs were in the room in Mr. Clay's
garden, where lectures were first delivered to women
students and others. But student life and university
instruction had for us its first embodiment in
the little community of five, and their teachers and
helpers, whose relations with Cambridge began
in 1871.</p>

<p>This settlement of Miss Clough and the five
students was the small beginning out of which grew
an institution which many hundreds of women now
regard with passionate loyalty, and which no
opponents or doubters can venture to despise. To
understand its origin we need to go back a little and
consider how and why the movement towards higher
education for women was then beginning to take
form, and why it came to be specially associated
with Cambridge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>


<p>It would be partly true and partly false to regard
the objects of those who practically founded Newnham
College as identical with those of the leading
champions of the political and legal rights of women.
Of course, as might naturally be expected, many of
those who, through breadth of sympathy and hatred
of injustice, gave the greater part of their lives
and energies to the removal of female disabilities,
public and private, were very ready to respond to
the demand for higher education for girls and
women. One need only think (looking at the leaders
of thought in the middle of last century) of John
Stuart Mill (a benefactor to the Cambridge Lectures
Association and to similar enterprises) with the
philosophic school which he represented and led.
The advocates of political liberty and those of higher
education for women used to a large extent the same
arguments, and the securing of one end favoured
the prospects of the other. Those who held that
women were on the eve of obtaining greater rights
and responsibilities were bound to show sympathy
with the cause of education; they could quote the
words of Samson Agonistes: "What were strength
without a double share of wisdom? Vast, unwieldy,
burdensome." And on the other hand
every movement made in the direction of sound
education for women told in favour of opening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
spheres of usefulness and conceding rights as to
property and personal liberty which uneducated
women might possibly have abused. Among the
earlier friends of Newnham, probably by far the
larger number were warmly attached to the franchise
movement, especially when it came within the range
of practical politics. At the same time, advocates
of higher education were unlikely to be possessed&mdash;as
were a few excellent and high-minded women&mdash;by
the idea of the suffrage as a panacea for all women's
grievances or a necessary condition of any step
towards social betterment. Necessity and common
sense prescribed caution to the pioneers who were
directing their efforts to obtain some measure of
university education for women able to profit
thereby.</p>

<p>And indeed there was nothing revolutionary in
the movement towards higher education for women.
True, the education of girls and women had not till
then been considered an object to be sought on a
large scale. But there had been educated and even
learned women in England, in the days of the
Renaissance and Reformation, though there can be
little doubt that&mdash;in the higher circles, at least&mdash;a
check came with the frivolities of the later Stuart
court. But without going into uncertain historical
details, it is noticeable that in the early part of the
nineteenth century, such different persons as Sydney
Smith and Mrs. Hannah More became eloquent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
advocates of more serious education for girls than
they commonly received. The arguments of these
and like-minded reformers were not thrown away.
It is beyond question that in many parts of England,
in early and middle Victorian days, there were high-minded,
intellectual, and accomplished women conducting
girls' schools on reasonable principles and
with good mental and moral results; and a good
deal of the highest education in girls' schools was
given by men&mdash;sometimes of considerable standing
and ability. The position of a private governess
was not remarkably dignified or lucrative (<i>vide</i> the
experiences of the Brontes); but there were some
such private teachers who did excellent and much
appreciated work.</p>

<p>Still the course of a girl who had inward longings
for intellectual culture was often hard; and harder
still was that of young women who had a liking
for literature and art, combined with a distaste for
unvaried domestic interests or social routine. The
happiest were those who had sympathetic elder
brothers at College, who could talk over their
difficulties with them and recommend books. Such
was eminently the position of Miss Clough herself.
Her education&mdash;discursive and not without
lacunae&mdash;had been a home education, her chief
mentor an Oxford brother, whose mind and tone
of character it is superfluous here to describe. It
was in great part to help those who, like herself,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
had had aspirations after knowledge and culture,
and who, unlike herself, had not always had sympathetic
homes, that she and other pioneers in
Cambridge desired to secure facilities of continuous
study under the direction of capable and inspiring
teachers.</p>

<p>It may be advisable to indicate briefly the different
ways in which efforts were made to meet the existing
wants, some of which led up to the goal of university
education for women.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>(1) The first step was the establishment of larger
and better schools, and provision for more advanced
teaching. Queen's College, Harley Street, first presided
over by F. D. Maurice, was founded in 1848
and is still at work; Bedford College (now a College
of London University) was founded in 1849; the
North London Collegiate School and Cheltenham
College (which both maintain their position as
schools of first-rate standing) in 1850 and 1858.
There were started, besides, some colleges expressly
for women intending to become teachers
(the Maria Grey, Home and Colonial, etc.). At
present the need of some serious training in the art
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
of teaching is widely recognised. In the early
days of the Women's Education Movement, a
young woman had often practically to choose
between gaining more knowledge, and learning to
make the most of the little which she had. This
difficulty is now much diminished, if not entirely
removed.</p>

<p>(2) But almost more important than the new
foundations, started generally by private effort, was
the successful attempt to secure some kind of
government inspection of girls' schools and the
synchronizing responsibility undertaken by the
Universities of Oxford and Cambridge in admitting
girls to the Local Examinations. In 1864, the
Schools Inquiry Commission were requested to
include in their task the inspection of Girls' Schools.
The result was a revelation of superficiality, narrowness,
and general inefficiency which awoke a portion
at least of the educated public to the need of reform.
The result of the new experiment (1865) of admitting
girls to the Cambridge Senior and Junior examinations
showed similar defects. Many generations of
Newnham students have been amused to hear
among the recollections revived at the annual
Commemoration, how it was once seriously proposed
to lower the standard of arithmetic to suit the
capacity of the girls. Happily the suggestion was
not followed. The notion that women cannot do
hard sums was one of the "hasty generalizations"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
as to the constitution of the female mind, "with
the wrecks of which," it was afterwards said, "the
whole shore has been strewn."</p>

<p>The deficiencies of the schools were largely due to
the fact that no opportunities of education were
available for intending teachers. The more enlightened
schoolmistresses had to struggle against
masses of prejudice, indifference and materialism
in the minds of parents and of the public, and many
of them were eager for improvement. In 1866, the
Society of London Schoolmistresses was formed
for mutual help and encouragement, and similar
societies were established in various localities, which
lent support to the efforts of well-wishers in the
Universities and elsewhere.</p>

<p>(3) Then again there were early schemes for lectures
to women in different parts of the country, and
these have branched out and become more effectual
than any measure for educational improvement
among persons for whom residence at a university
was impossible. Here, as in many regions, Miss
Clough was a pioneer, and this branch of work
brought about the connection of Cambridge with
one side of the movement and led directly to the
starting of what grew into Newnham College.</p>

<p>The body which accomplished the chief initial
work in the matter of local lectures for women was
"The North of England Council for improving the
Education of Women." To the organization of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
society, Miss Clough gave much thought and attention,
especially in 1867 and the following years.
It was formed from an amalgamation of societies
having the same object, in Liverpool, Manchester,
Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle. Among Miss
Clough's colleagues on this Council were Mr. (afterwards
Canon) and Mrs. Butler, Mr. (now Lord)
Bryce, Mr. F. W. H. Myers, and Mr. (afterwards
Professor) James Stuart. It was Mr. Stuart who,
after his experience in the North of England, proposed
and brought about in 1873 the organization of local
lectures by the Universities. It is needless to go
into the history of the subsequent development of
University Extension. Begun primarily in the
interests of women, it was extended to meet the
needs of busy men with free evenings, working
people, and all who wished in their leisure to prolong
their education and gain culture.</p>

<p>(4) The work of the North of England Council led
to a further step in the early development of what
I have called "Newnham College in Idea," viz.
the founding of the Cambridge Higher Local Examination.
The request for an examination for
women over eighteen came from the Council
and was supported on the ground that it was
desirable to have a definite and intelligible test
for teachers, with some means of giving system
to the lecture movement as far as it affected women,
and of directing the reading of girls who had left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
school. It had originally features which became
modified with changing principles of education.
There was at first a group of subjects considered
essential as the foundation of liberal education and
optional groups, some of which candidates had to
take in order to secure a certificate. In course of
time the groups were increased in number and
larger choice allowed while the necessary preliminaries
were diminished.</p>

<p>The examination was first held in 1869, when
thirty-six candidates were examined in two centres.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
As this examination was from the first supposed to
be one the reading for which would prove interesting
and profitable to adult women, it is not surprising
that it should have been eagerly used by the advocates
of university education for intending teachers
as a test of fitness for real university study. Later it
became one of the school examinations taken by
girls in the upper forms, and when the Tripos
examinations were opened to women certain portions
were accepted in lieu of the Previous Examination.
The connection between Newnham and the Higher
Local Examination was maintained for many years,
certain scholarships being always awarded on its
results, though the multiplication of other facilities
for university qualification has now loosened the
tie. In the early days Newnham College owed
much to the Syndicate for Local Lectures and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
Examinations, and to the courtesy and devotion of
the successive Secretaries (Rev. G. F. (Bishop)
Browne and Dr. Keynes) and to the fostering care
which they bestowed on the young movement.</p>

<p>Here an auxiliary agency may be mentioned
which was of real service to young women desirous
either of passing the new examination or simply
of understanding how and what to read for their
own benefit: the scheme of instruction by correspondence,
started and kept vigorous for many years
by the late Mrs. Peile, wife of the highly respected
tutor and afterwards Master of Christ's College.
Among the instructors by correspondence were many
distinguished members of the University. The curricula
were designed with a view to the requirements
of the Higher Local Examination, but subjects were
handled freely and suitable books were recommended.
This last necessity was partly met by a
loan library for women.</p>

<p>These steps were gradually leading up to a
possible university education for women. At first
sight, our beginnings may seem to have a non-academic
and amateurish air. And part of what
was accomplished in these early days would meet
with scant approval from modern advocates of equal
chances for women with men in learning and the
learned professions. Inspection of schools by
government is now by many regarded as a necessary
evil. Popular courses of lectures without regular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
sequence or adaptation to the previous attainments
of those who attend them suggest superficiality and
lack of scientific method. Instruction by correspondence
is by many associated with cram of the
lowest sort. But to those who read the correspondence
of the founders of these institutions, or whose
memory carries them back to the days when they
were not only novel but a very godsend to labourers
at self-education, the whole movement wears a
different aspect. All methods of imparting knowledge
are apt to degenerate into tricks for hiding
ignorance; even respect for universities and learned
men may become mere toadyism. But the early
forms, though now a little outworn, did indicate and
partly supply a genuine need, and led on to even
better things&mdash;especially to academic training and
advanced study for women.</p>

<p>(5) The general movement towards university
education, on the other hand, begins with the
inauguration of a series of lectures in Cambridge
itself, somewhat like that already started in the
north, but wider in scope and capable of being
continued for the instruction of women far beyond
the educational standard prescribed by the Local
Examinations. This had its beginning in a drawing-room
meeting held in Prof. and Mrs. Fawcett's
house, late in 1869.</p>

<p>If these beginnings seem less dignified than those
of Colleges erected for students and organized from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
the first on University lines, it may be remarked that,
after all, the beginnings of Newnham bear some
analogy to those of the early European universities,
including the English. Perhaps in all the greatest
centres of learning there has been first the great
teacher&mdash;then the scholars who flock to sit at his
feet. Colleges and social student life and hostels
and regulated grades of teachers and taught are an
aftergrowth. So, we may say, the first Newnham
students came to Cambridge because great teachers
were there; it was not that suitable teachers
came because the students had shown a demand for
them or for collegiate houses and collegiate life.
The university extension lecturers might be useful
and stimulating missionaries of culture, but their
greatest service was to kindle a desire to go and
drink at the fountain-heads. The mountain could
not come to Mahomet, but many touched by prophetic
zeal might make all efforts to come to the
mountain.</p>

<p>The first step taken as a result of the historic
meeting referred to in Prof. and Mrs. Fawcett's
house, was the formation of a society to be called
<i>the Association for promoting the Higher Education
of Women in Cambridge</i>.</p>

<p>The first executive consisted of Mr. (afterwards
Dr.) Bonney, Mr. (Dr.) Peile, Prof. F. D. Maurice,
Mrs. Adams, Mrs. Bateson, Mrs. Fawcett, Mrs. Venn;
the Secretaries were Mr. Markby and Mr. (afterwards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
Professor) Henry Sidgwick; the Treasurer Mrs.
Bateson. Early in 1870, a list of lectures was
brought out. Although these lectures were supposed
to be for women reading for the Higher (then called
the Women's) examination, they were given by men
generally of the highest standing in the University,
such as the university members of the Executive
just mentioned, besides Professor Skeat, Prof. J. E. B.
Mayor, Dr. Peile, Prof. Cayley, Dr. Venn, Mr.
Marshall and other eminent persons. It may be
that some of these lecturers were decidedly "over
the heads" of such of the students as had had an
indifferent schooling and were only just commencing
adult study. But the fault&mdash;if such we should call
it&mdash;was a good one. As a rule, the partly self-taught
are more ready to grapple with difficulties than such
as have hitherto had the paths of progress made
gradual and easy; and the very fact of being more
or less in contact with a master mind was rather
stimulating than depressing.</p>

<p>These lectures were originally given in a building
kindly lent by Mr. Clay, standing in the garden of
his house a little off Trumpington Street.</p>

<p>Besides the lectures specially arranged in connection
with the new scheme, a large number of
lectures given by Professors of the University were,
by their special permission, opened to women. In
those days the professorial lectures formed, generally
speaking, a less important part in the teaching of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
the University than they do at present. This was
not, of course, due to any inferiority in such lectures,
but to the want of correlation in the instruction
provided by the several colleges and by the University.
As this correlation became more effectual,
the privilege given to women students of attending
professorial lectures became more and more advantageous
to them. Twenty-eight professors acceded
to the request of the Association, as well as two
lecturers who delivered their lectures in University
buildings. University Professors and Lecturers were,
generally speaking, bound to admit all members
of the University to their lectures without fee, but
were allowed to charge fees to non-members.
Women students came, of course, under the second
head, but as a rule the Professors admitted them
without fee, as if they were of undergraduate status.
The gradual opening up of lectures given on the
Intercollegiate system in the halls or lecture-rooms
of the various colleges began, as will be seen, a
little later.</p>

<p>But besides the special lectures to women and the
professorial lectures provided for members of the
University, a very necessary element in Cambridge
teaching consists in private tuition&mdash;of students
taken individually or in small groups. In Classics
and Mathematics, especially, such "coaching" is
necessary both for backward and for advanced
students. Among the earlier supporters of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
Women's Education movement were a good many
brilliant teachers who, in their generous belief in
the cause, were ready to give instruction to women
students often in a far more elementary stage than
the men they ordinarily taught. Fees were naturally
paid to the private teachers, but in many cases,
while the cause was yet poor and struggling, these
fees were returned to the Treasurer.</p>

<p>The students who required the more advanced
lectures and tuition were generally those who, having
passed the Women's Examination, aimed at a real
University course. Tripos students were among
the very first generation of Cambridge women&mdash;though
those who read with a view to triposes
could never feel quite sure, till near the end of
their three years, whether the examiners would think
it consistent with their functions to admit women
and declare what class they attained.</p>

<p>This great object had already been approached
on independent lines by the founders of Girton
College. Miss Davies had conceived hopes of founding
an actual college in which the Cambridge degree
examinations, pass and honour, might be taken by
women, and in 1869 such a college was started
at Hitchin. The intellectual ideals and standards
of the two wings&mdash;so to speak&mdash;of the movement
were not identical. Time and with it changes in
the demands of the degree examinations at Cambridge&mdash;indeed
at both Universities&mdash;have brought
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
them pretty close together. The very good reasons
at the bottom of both programmes are easy to
recognise. Miss Davies considered that any requirements
made from women different from those
demanded from men would certainly be lower. If
women avoided Greek and the other subjects of
which boys were supposed to learn something at
school, an impression would be created that women
were allowed graduate or quasi-graduate status
on easier terms than those imposed on men. On
the other side there was, in the minds of Sidgwick
and others who became the founders of Newnham,
a great contempt of the "Poll" as well as of the
"Little-go" as marking a very low standard of
intellectual achievement. At the same time, a
more concrete mind like Miss Clough's deplored the
inconvenience and waste of time which might keep
an adult woman who had not learned classics or
much mathematics at school, studying the beginnings
of these subjects in school-boy fashion when
her mind was more adapted to other studies. Again
there was the fear&mdash;groundless enough as experience
has proved&mdash;lest the girls' schools should be
"classicized" and modern studies in them discouraged.
In point of fact, Cambridge University
now demands of candidates for the Previous Examinations
only the very minimum of ancient
languages, and the boys' schools have been de-classicized
to a further extent than might have then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
seemed possible. In the long run, the different
schemes proved to be very similar in results. The
Little-go Greek did no harm to those who took
it. Honestly taught (as, unfortunately, is not
always the case with a compulsory subject), it has
often given to the learner sufficient knowledge to
be of real service in later studies. A small amount
of rivalry at the outset has not hindered the progress
of the two Colleges side by side in co-operation and
mutual goodwill.</p>

<p class="medium center"> MISS MARION KENNEDY.</p>
</div>

<p>But before the first tripos student had definitely
entered on her career, another great step had been
taken: the opening of a house for the residence
of women who had been attracted by the educational
facilities of Cambridge and desired to devote
themselves there to some course of serious study.
The securing of a house for students had become
necessary in the eyes of Mr. Henry Sidgwick, and
foremost among the many and great services which
he rendered to the College (then hardly existing
even in idea) was that he persuaded Miss Clough to
come and take charge of the resident students.
A house was found in Regent Street, and in the
autumn of 1871 Miss Clough and five students
began their common life there, and initiated a new
stage in the movement.</p>

<p>Long years afterwards, when Newnham was large
and flourishing, with four Halls of residence, a large
party up for Commemoration met to explore the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
cradle of this College, which was the more easily
done as the house had become a hotel (The Bird
Bolt Temperance Hotel). Two of the original five
(Mrs. Marshall and Miss Larner) pointed out to
the students of that day the one room which
served as dining-room and as common study for
these pioneer students; the other sitting-room
used in the afternoon for lectures, overlooking
Parker's Piece, where they, without a scrap of
garden, could envy the boys playing on the Piece;
the small rooms which were their bedrooms. The
first generation had little elbow-room, no games, a
scanty library, a non-luxurious <i>ménage</i>, and very little
of what is now considered necessary freedom in work
and play. Yet they seem to have been exceedingly
happy. They felt, and the feeling remained for at
least a dozen years, that they were pioneers. The
lectures given by greater men than any they had
ever seen before; the pleasures of intercourse,
especially for those who had found little intellectual
sympathy at home; the long walks over
the Gogs or along the Cam, more enjoyed in
pre-hockey, pre-bicycling, even pre-tennis days than
now; the associations of an ancient and beautiful
town; the sympathy shown by the generous men
and women who had adopted their cause: all these
things must far have outweighed the passing
inconvenience of straitened accommodation and
even the painful consciousness that the eye of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
world and yet more of his wife was upon them, for
better and for worse. But perhaps above all, in
later days, these pioneer students felt most thankful
to think that in that house they had enjoyed the
constant presence of Miss Clough and frequent
intercourse with the leaders of the movement,
particularly of Mr. Henry Sidgwick.</p>

<p>It may seem superfluous as well as presumptuous
for the present writer to dwell on the characteristics
of the two leading persons in the early days of the
College (or the college-embryo) seeing that their
lives and characters have, as already said, been
portrayed in biographies which are never likely to
be surpassed. Perhaps, however, a little space
may be given to those peculiarities which, in both
characters, left a permanent impression on the
College as a whole, especially since they exhibit
traits of an almost opposite description, yet united
to produce a great result. In one respect they were
alike: in what may be called fundamental sincerity
and whole-heartedness, along with wide ranges of
interest. Readers of Sidgwick's life and writings
cannot but be impressed with his absolute fidelity
to any course which had shown itself worthy of
approval, his careful attention to every opinion
and principle which had any reasonable justification,
his loyalty to personal convictions in avoiding any
possible compromise with mental tergiversation.
He had lately given up his fellowship from conscientious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
motives. He abstained from identifying
himself with any form of institutional Christianity,
while fully acknowledging how such Christianity had
worked for good, and tolerating the attitude of
those who were able for the sake of true religion to
accept religious formulae with reservations of their
own. In politics, he generally went with the
more progressive Liberals, though fully able and
always ready to grasp the situation of those who
took different standpoints. The efforts and the
personal sacrifices which he made in the cause of
women's education were not inspired by any one-sided
attachment to the cause either on a personal
or on a theoretical side. He held no fixed theory
as to the equality and similarity of the sexes in
mental powers, but was in favour of assisting
legitimate efforts, removing unreasonable limitations,
and postponing the decision as to whether
women <i>can</i> do this or that by giving them the
opportunity and awaiting the result. When the
result proved favourable to his reasoned expectations,
he was naturally pleased, but on all subjects
he ever kept an open mind. For persons handicapped
in the race of life, by sex, nationality, or
poverty, he was always ready to discover new
prospects of successful effort. His family life had
made him acquainted with women of exceptional
gifts even before his marriage with Miss Eleanor
Mildred Balfour in 1876, a happy event for Newnham<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
as well as for himself. The frequent presence of a
man of his calibre in the incipient college was of
inestimable benefit to the early students. He was
to them a champion of their cause and a model of
sincerity and reasonableness, and to many a very
helpful teacher. A larger proportion of students
in the early days than later took up some branch
of Moral Science&mdash;in which he directed their work.
And to others he was helpful on the educational
side by his encouragement of good literature&mdash;which
may at times have tended to retreat into the
background in favour of severely scientific study.
Beyond all this there were traditions among the
early students of his extraordinary power in bringing
home to them the necessity of maintaining a high
standard of order, patience and power of suspending
judgment.</p>

<p>It has been said that in some respects Miss Clough
presented a marked contrast to Dr. Sidgwick.
This contrast may be partly described by saying
that he saw things more in the abstract, she in the
concrete. Not that he looked only at general
principles and she at isolated instances (for both
took large views without neglecting the single
examples), but still the distinction was evident.
Both had risen by a painful process of mental and
moral self-culture above conventional views as to
the world and man's place in it, but in Sidgwick
the search was chiefly inspired by a passion for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
truth, in Miss Clough by a desire to promote individual
happiness. She naturally referred questions
to present cases. Thus&mdash;if certain subjects were
said to be necessary as preliminaries to a University
course, she would at once think whether <i>A.</i> or <i>B.</i>
would be the better for having studied Latin or Mathematics.
She allowed for diversity of all kinds among
students and other persons with whom she had to
do. A rule was important to her as touching actual
cases, not the cases as exemplifying the rule. She
was strong physically and indifferent to discomfort
and hardship in all that she undertook. Yet she
had no belief in asceticism, and exhorted her students
to "take the little pleasures of life." It was her
own idea to begin hockey at Newnham, then a most
novel suggestion, which brought at first some
ridicule and even disapprobation from select circles.
She naturally understood and liked some of her
students better than others&mdash;but even those who
had less than others of her special intimacy were at
times pleased and stimulated by finding how much
of her goodwill they possessed and how she had
plans for their future. If her character broadened
and mellowed with years, it was not that she was
ever intolerant or unsympathetic, but that she
responded to the affection and respect of those
who knew and appreciated her. She, too, had a
sense of humour which enlivened the community
from the beginning, and the respect with which both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
her name and her character were held in the highest
University circles more than counteracted an
occasional innocent unconventionality in her social
intercourse.</p>

<p>It may seem almost invidious to choose some and
omit others among the earliest friends of Newnham,
in awarding due meed of praise and gratitude, but
certainly the two who have been lightly sketched
here were undoubtedly the foremost of Newnham's
benefactors. Early students will remember others
who have passed away: the Miss Kennedys, with
their kind and gracious hospitality, and care for
the rather homeless persons who ranked among
"out-students"; Mr. Coutts Trotter, who was
Chairman of the Council, and left his library to the
College; Mr. W. H. H. Hudson, who was financial
adviser and auditor for 33 years; Mr. Archer-Hind,
who placed his refined scholarship at the disposal
of mere beginners in Greek, was always willing
to make one lesson swell out into two&mdash;and took
no fees; Mr. Main, the standby of the earliest
students of Natural Science; Mr. Marshall, who
created and directed an enthusiastic devotion to
the study of Economics; Mrs. Bateson, who originally
dispensed the lecture tickets to students entering
their course, and whose parties at St. John's Lodge
were highly appreciated;&mdash;and many more.</p>

<p>The students who were first attracted to the
opportunities for women in Cambridge were, as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
rule, somewhat more mature, though less well
instructed, than those of later times. There were
exceptions in this latter respect, as in the case of
the late Miss Edith Creak, well known in the educational
world, who was the daughter of a schoolmaster,
and who passed successfully both the
mathematical and the classical triposes at the age
of nineteen. Another of the original five was Mrs.
Armitage (<i>née</i> Bulley), who has written much on
early English antiquities and is an authority on
Barrows. Among the first to take Triposes were
Miss Paley (now Mrs. A. Marshall) and Miss Amy
Bulley, who were successful in the Moral Sciences
Tripos in 1874, Miss Mary Kennedy, afterwards
Mrs. R. T. Wright, in the same Tripos in 1875,
and Miss Felicia Larner who took the Historical
Tripos in 1875. These ladies were all examined
by private favour of the examiners, the greatest
care being taken that all formalities should be duly
observed. Only, they were admitted after passing
certain Groups of the Women's Examinations
instead of the Previous Examination, and, in one
or two cases, were allowed a longer time of preparation
than the University regulations prescribed.</p>

<p>The exaggerated dread of triposes and admiration
for those who achieved them makes an amusing
feature in early Newnham days. It would now
seem absurd for a college to exult over second class
honours. But every successful student helped to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
destroy some of the "hasty generalizations"
repeated outside as to women in triposes, the first
being that they would fail or else break down in
health. When they succeeded and remained
vigorous, it was said that they might get through
but would not get first classes. When they obtained
first classes in the newer triposes, it was declared
that they would never get a first class in
classics or mathematics. The death-blow to all
these hypotheses came in 1890, when Miss Philippa
Fawcett's name was read in the Senate House as
"above the Senior Wrangler." There was a kind
of poetic justice in this event, as Miss Fawcett's
parents had been earnest and effectual helpers of
the movement from the very beginning.</p>

<p>This, however, is to anticipate events. During
the early days in Regent Street, good work was
being done, and the students had a happy life, but
they were cooped in a small space, and the friends of
the movement had to seek both a larger home and
more funds to sustain it. From 1872-1874, Miss
Clough and the students found a congenial house
of residence behind St. John's College. This was
Merton Hall, an old manor house with a very
pleasant garden and other attractions. Here something
like collegiate life was first begun&mdash;with a
debating society, games (with limitations) and
various collective interests. Another house in
Trumpington Street was hired to accommodate the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
overflow of students. A few who had been attracted
by the lectures, but for some reason were unable
or unwilling to enter a hall of residence, formed a
kind of outer circle. These "out-students" were
made to feel less of outsiders by the kind and
hospitable attention bestowed on them by Miss
Marion Kennedy. Their number tended to diminish,
as membership of a college or hall came to be
desirable on social and disciplinary grounds. When
the College was more definitely constituted, all who
wished to become regular students were obliged
to reside either in a Hall of Newnham or with
parents and guardians, exceptions only being
allowed in the case of women above the undergraduate
age.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p class="medium center"> MERTON HALL, 1872-1874.</p>
</div>

<p>Meantime arrangements were being made to
secure a more permanent place of residence. To
meet what had become a necessity, it was proposed
to form a Company, which, after the choice of a
site near the village of Newnham, was called the
Newnham Hall Company. There was, however, a
singular absence of commercial acquisitiveness or
speculation in the Society which bore this financial
designation. A good deal of the money subscribed
came from benefactors who so far from seeking
profit from their investments continued their gifts
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
for many years. Mention may be made of Miss
Ewart, Mr. and Mrs. Stephen Winkworth, Miss
Bonham Carter among other munificent benefactors.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
A good many well-wishers who could not give
princely contributions were ready to make the
venture of faith and to subscribe for shares. The
result was that in 1875 Newnham Hall was opened
and Miss Clough with the students entered into
residence. They had during 1874-75 occupied a
dwelling in Bateman Street where Miss Clough had
ingeniously secured the use of a house-and-a-half
which she made into one. Newnham Hall was a
Queen Anne building, of red brick, which has
mellowed after its forty years. The architect, Mr.
Basil Champneys, took a strong personal interest
in its original plan and subsequent extension.
Those who knew it when it was simply Newnham
Hall (later called the <i>South</i>, now the <i>Old Hall</i>) must
feel a little regret that its imposing south front&mdash;intended
to be the actual front&mdash;is only seen by a
minority of casual visitors. In fact, no one knew
in '75 in what direction, if in any, it might have to
expand, and there is a story current that in the
plans, the possibility was considered of transforming
it&mdash;if a hall for women students proved a failure&mdash;into
two ordinary dwelling-houses.</p>

<p>The College, formally so-called, came into existence
by the amalgamation of the two societies, "The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
Association for the promotion of the Higher Education
of Women in Cambridge" (more briefly called the
"Lectures Association") and the "Newnham Hall
Company, Limited," in 1880. The new title adopted
was "The Newnham College Association for advancing
Education and Learning among Women in
Cambridge." Before this time, the "College"
only existed in idea, but that existence, as we have
seen, was a very real one. Even when it attained
its first permanent habitation, it was&mdash;for a college&mdash;small,
as in 1876 there were only about thirty
students besides the out-students. But it had a
respectable, academic-looking exterior, and life within
was vigorous. Among the residents was Miss Paley,
now Mrs. Marshall, whom the students with pride
regarded as their earliest don, one of the first five,
and one of the earliest to take a tripos. She proved
a very successful teacher of Political Economy, a
popular subject among the early students, many of
whom were ambitious of some career of social
activity. Classical students were few, but very
eager. Miss J. E. Harrison and Miss K. Corfe took
their tripos in 1879. Natural Sciences were pursued
with ardour and success, partly through the liberality
of St. John's College in admitting Newnham students
to their laboratory before the Newnham laboratory
was built. The first student to obtain a first class
was Miss Ogle, afterwards Mrs. Koppel, in 1876.
It is gratifying that her daughter afterwards became<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
a Newnham student, and has made herself educationally
useful in South Africa. Mathematics held
its own. The Historical Tripos, when separated
from the Law, attracted several students. Those
who took Moral Sciences, as already said, enjoyed
the special attention of Mr. Sidgwick.</p>

<p>These candidates were all, of course, examined
informally, <i>i.e.</i> by special favour of individual
examiners. It was from the first desired by Mr.
Sidgwick that any student who showed, by marked
success in the Women's Examination or in any
other way, that she had real aptitude for intellectual
culture, should be encouraged to proceed to a
Tripos. But in the early days the Tripos students
were not the only ones who were capable of good
intellectual work. Some, as has been said, for
one reason or another, did not follow the lines
then laid down for Triposes, and the variety was&mdash;socially
and intellectually&mdash;an excellent thing for
the students. Specialization in study is often
bound to have a narrowing effect. But by student
friendships, young people learn to care for things
in heaven and earth that will never lie within their
special province. It is a good thing for Cambridge,
and consequently for Newnham, that there is no such
iron bar fixed there between Sciences and Arts,
as often, in other educational institutions, tends
to prejudice and narrowness. There may be, before
definite lines are fixed, tendencies to too much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
diffusion; this, however, was prevented by the
general system of tuition.</p>

<p>As yet, in 1879, there were not many resident
tutors to settle the work of students in their several
departments. But competent University men were
always ready to put their knowledge and experience
at the service of a student choosing her University
course. Indeed the helpfulness of men on whom
the students had no claim, is one of the brightest
features, even of the bright days of Newnham's
beginnings.</p>

<p>Newnham Hall had from the first a fairly large
garden, not very minutely laid out,<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> but large enough
for tennis, for which game an ash court was
made. A gymnasium, in the pre-games period,
seemed a necessity, and was erected and opened in
1877. Before that time, students had been allowed
to go at stated times to the gymnasium in the town,
and strange now to relate, some did so with great
enthusiasm. But the interest in indoor gymnastics
declined with the greater facility for out-door sport,
of which more later on.</p>

<p>Newnham Hall was more in the country then than
the College is at present. It must be remembered
that married dons with their families were a
comparatively new institution, the residential
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
quarter to the west did not exist at this time in
Cambridge, and certainly Newnham was in the
pleasantest part of Cambridge for country walks.
"Constitutionals" are now out of favour, but the
early students enjoyed the "Grantchester Grind,"&mdash;especially
when the marsh-marigolds were out,
and the Madingley Woods with their blue-bells, and
the Roman Road in blue flax season; and the Backs
were very near; there were nightingales too whose
nocturnal songs were by some found almost too
penetrating. There was an atmosphere, in town and
country, favourable to cheerfulness, to the formation
of friendships, to the development of intellectual and
social activity, to the enlargement of opportunities
for women in forwarding the betterment of the
world. It was a time of hope for youth, seen not
only in the pioneer students, but in those champions
of their cause, some themselves young, some older,
whose efforts for the next generation were ever
strenuous and cheerful, none the less so for the
experience of resistance from old-world inertia and
the dead weight of prejudice which only patience
and wisdom could ever prevail to lift.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II<br />

<span class="st">NEWNHAM COLLEGE IN ADOLESCENCE</span></h2>


<p>The early part of the eighties was full of events for the
women students of Newnham and their supporters.
In these years they obtained (1) a fixed legal constitution;
(2) a second hall of residence, and other
much needed buildings; (3) gradual increase of
facilities for study, especially in the opening of
Cambridge College lectures to women; (4) more
important still, a large measure of University
recognition, and (5) greater opportunities of educational
and social work for past students. These
several lines of progress may here be taken in
order, except the fifth, which I reserve for the next
chapter.</p>

<p>(1) It has been mentioned that when the necessity
arose of increasing accommodation for women
students, an amalgamation was in 1879 discussed
of the <i>Association for the Higher Education of Women
in Cambridge</i> with the <i>Newnham Hall Company</i>.
The Memorandum and Articles of Association were
drawn up before long, and Newnham College came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
into existence and was registered in the spring of
1880. The constitution was not entirely according
to the character of an Academic institution, being
under the financial control of the Board of Trade.
There was a provision that no profits should
accrue to members of the College in the legal
sense of the word <i>members</i>, though members
might receive remuneration for work done for
the College. The Ordinary Members consisted of
the first promoters of the College, with large subscribers
to its funds afterwards; Associate Members
(helpers and benefactors, not to be confounded with
the present Associates); and Honorary Members,
mostly teachers and helpers of the students. The
government rested with a Council, to be elected at
a general meeting of Members of the College, four
going out annually in rotation, but re-eligible. The
executive officers were to be a President, Vice-President,
and Secretary. The President and the
Principal were to be <i>ex officio</i> members. There
was as yet no systematic representation of quasi-graduate
students, but the resident lecturers were
as a rule entitled to vote as ordinary or as honorary
members.</p>

<p>We shall see later on in what respects this Memorandum
of Association came to be regarded as
inadequate. In point of fact, it marked progress
in stability, and worked very well for many
years. The Council generally consisted of persons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
enthusiastically devoted to the interests of the
College, and many of them able, by their experience
on educational bodies or by their social
influence, to assist in its development along the
best lines.</p>

<p>(2) Materially, the great event of 1880-81 was
the completion and opening of the second Hall of
Residence, the North Hall, as it was called, the
name South Hall being given to the earlier
Newnham Hall. The ground on which it was
built was on the other side of a narrow road. In the
daytime, when gates could be kept open, passage
from one Hall to the other was easy, but at night,
for privacy's sake, it was necessary that they should
be closed. This, of course, was a check to late
evening parties for cocoa, chat, or dancing, among
the students belonging to separate Halls, and the
concession of one open evening a week hardly met
the difficulty. There seemed to be a danger lest
<i>Hall</i> feeling might endanger devotion to the College
as a whole, and one might expect that the fact of
the Principal residing in the older building and
only a Vice-Principal in the newer might seem to
imply some kind of inferiority. Any danger of the
kind was avoided by an act of generous devotion
on the part of two promoters of the College which
could hardly have been foretold.</p>

<p>The great services of Dr. Sidgwick to the incipient
College have been alluded to, though they are far<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
too wide and various to be severally recorded.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
His wife, formerly Miss Eleanor Balfour, had for
some years been a very able treasurer and member of
council. She had given a scholarship to Newnham
in Mathematics, her own chief subject of study at
that time. They lived a quiet, scholarly, but
sociable life in their house at Hillside, at the beginning
of the Chesterton Road. At this moment, when
anyone of less standing in the University and the
world generally could hardly have met the emergency,
Mrs. Sidgwick agreed to come and preside
in the new Hall, with the title of Vice-Principal,
and Mr. Sidgwick came to live there also, thus
giving up his privacy and the company of most of
his books. The arrangement was the more successful
in that Miss Gladstone also took up residence in the
North Hall as her secretary. The name of Gladstone
brought distinction with it. Miss Helen Gladstone
had resided as a student of English and Political
Economy for one year with the Sidgwicks and for
two years in Newnham Hall, and was deservedly
popular both with the students and in the University
world outside. Students who entered the College,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
and were taken into the new Hall, cherished ever
after the memory of these two years as a halcyon
time&mdash;in which they enjoyed listening to good talk
and associating with interesting persons more than
during any other period of their lives. At the end
of two years, Miss Gladstone became Vice-Principal,
resident in the North Hall, a post which she held
for many years, and in which her well-known
geniality, cheerfulness, and whole-hearted devotion
to her task and to the students under her care
found abundant scope and recognition.</p>

<p>It was under the same roof as the North Hall that
the much needed lecture rooms were raised. There
were at first three. Later when a large number of
small rooms for private teaching were made in the
Pfeiffer Building, two of the lecture rooms proper
were knocked into one, thereby giving the College
one room large enough to accommodate (if desks
were removed) about a hundred people. It was
chiefly by pressure from Miss Gladstone that an
infirmary or hospital was built, adjoining the North
Hall, but with its separate entrance. This has
often proved useful in checking the spread of
infectious ailments among the students or the
servants. A chemical laboratory had already been
erected in the garden at a respectful distance from
the original Hall. Its equipment was mainly the
task of Miss Penelope Lawrence, afterwards headmistress
of Roedean School, Brighton. A laboratory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
for the study of Biological subjects was provided
in the town in 1884, a disused Congregational
chapel being adapted to the purpose. Mrs. Sidgwick
and her sister, Miss Alice Balfour, were the principal
donors, and the laboratory was appropriately named
after their brother, Francis Maitland Balfour, whose
promising and already distinguished career had been
cut short by an accident in the Alps. For many
years, these two laboratories formed the training
ground of a large number of students, who did much
to supply the demand for improved science teaching
in schools and colleges for girls. In the Chemical
Laboratory Miss Freund and in the Balfour Laboratory
Miss Greenwood (now Mrs. Bidder) and Miss
Saunders presided for many years, carrying on both
teaching and research. (Both Miss Freund and Mrs.
Bidder were former students of Girton.) In course
of time, the opening of the University laboratories
to women students rendered these buildings less
necessary, and they are at present let for University
purposes.</p>

<p>With the increase in the number of students,
further buildings became necessary. The South Hall
(formerly Newnham Hall) had been designed with
a view to possible extension, and in 1882, a west
wing was built, containing rooms for about twelve
more students. The ground floor of this building
was devoted to a well-planned Library, at that
time a great desideratum. The equipment of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
College as to books had originally been scanty.
Perhaps the need of books was, for a time, not
altogether to be deplored, as the early generation
of students realized the necessity of procuring their
own books or of inducing generous friends to assist
them in that direction; and many gave books as
a parting present to the College. A moderate-sized
common-room in the Old Hall (since divided into
two rooms for students) was the first library, but
was soon outgrown. But when something larger
was required, the new Library (now the Reading
Room of the Old Hall) both served its purpose till
the books again outran the accommodation, and
afforded a delightful morning room for study, as
well as space for occasional social parties.</p>

<p>(3) During the late 'seventies and the early
'eighties, women students were informally admitted
to privileges which greatly facilitated their work,
and in particular many College lectures were opened
to them. Their own lectures&mdash;before the building
of Sidgwick Hall&mdash;were given in the rooms belonging
to the Young Men's Christian Association, near the
old Post Office, a central but somewhat noisy situation.
The larger rooms in this building were of
good size and convenient, but the class-rooms were
less so, and to many students their first introduction
to Greek Tragedy or to English Law will always be
associated with the striking of a hammer on the
blacksmith's anvil. The new lecture rooms at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
Newnham had not this drawback. The professorial
lectures were generally given in rooms now absorbed
in the University Library. In some, women were
allowed to come into the gallery, where their presence
was not easily discerned. But meantime, as
already mentioned, some of the Colleges were ready
to accept suggestions as to admitting women to the
Inter-collegiate Lectures. The first of the Colleges
to admit women to lectures in its own hall was
Christ's. In the summer term of 1876, eight
students of Newnham College (some working at
classics, others at history) were admitted to a
course of lectures on the Punic Wars given by
Mr. (now Professor) J. S. Reid in the temporary
dining-hall of Christ's. Great efforts were made to
meet the somewhat exacting demands&mdash;in those
days&mdash;of social propriety. Thus these students
were obliged always to be chaperoned by a responsible
lady, and as Miss Clough had in the early days
few colleagues to lighten her responsibilities, the
task usually fell on her. Needless to say, she never
represented this as a grievance, though the lectures
were three times a week, the hour inconvenient, and
the weather generally wet. She was only too glad
to help in a new departure, and, as she said (with
reminiscences of her brother and Dr. Arnold), she
always found Roman History interesting.</p>

<p>King's was the next College to admit women.
Trinity not till a little later. It may be noticed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
without any disparagement of the lecturers who
obtained these concessions, that in the case of
those already lecturing to women according to the
previous arrangements, it was more convenient to
have seats assigned to the women in the College
lecture rooms or halls than to give the same lecture
to their men pupils in College in the morning and
to the women in a room belonging to the Young
Men's Christian Association, or even in Newnham
College, in the afternoon. Nevertheless Newnham
owes gratitude to the Lecturers and to the Fellows
of Colleges who showed, in many cases, both zeal
and courtesy in meeting the women students' needs.
With regard to the undergraduates, it may be
remarked that though at first some showed a curious
amazement mixed with bashfulness at their strange
visitors, they soon accustomed themselves to the
change, and showed almost always a spirit of
courtesy and good sense. As more accommodation
came to be provided by the University&mdash;irrespective
of College distinctions&mdash;in the New Divinity Schools
and the New Lecture Rooms, access to lectures
became easier for women, as for other non-members
of the University.</p>

<p>Another great advantage which the students
obtained in these years was permission to read in
the University Library. They could not be admitted
without referees, such as were demanded
from non-university persons, but the Principal was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
always accepted as one referee, so that the student
candidate had to find one only. Fees&mdash;very
moderate&mdash;were paid by the College when a student
had been specially advised to read in the Library.
Formal admission was granted for the morning
only, but a student who for any special reason
wished to read in the afternoon as well could easily
obtain permission.</p>

<p>Another privilege gradually obtained without any
special effort was that of being examined in the
Inter-collegiate Examinations popularly called <i>Mays</i>.
As all Cambridge men and women know, examinations
of students in their first and second years are
held in most subjects at the end of the summer
term, to test their knowledge and power of expressing
it. These are not directly under any University
board, but are given by the lecturers on the subjects
they have been teaching, in various Colleges, during
the past year. The "Mays," in spite of drawbacks,
have often been of great value, in giving confidence
to industrious but despondent students, and in
warning those whose progress was unsatisfactory.
The fact of having been through a certain course,
examined on the subject, and marked with the
undergraduates, emphasised the fact to the women
students, the undergraduates, and the world at
large, that the work done at Newnham and Girton
was really of University standing.</p>

<p>(4) All these steps led towards what was necessary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
in order that the work of the College should be
solid and permanent&mdash;the recognition by the University
of the existence of women students and
women of what I have called quasi-graduate status.
It may be said&mdash;it was said, and still is said when
further demands are made&mdash;that women had the
real thing, why trouble about the artificial trappings?
Women could become well-educated, even
learned; those who had studied at Cambridge were
the better esteemed in educational circles, and they
were free from many tiresome responsibilities that
weigh on full members of the University. But to
this was answered: that the path to good education
and sound learning is still more thorny than it
need be; that the world, which often has to distribute
educational posts and distinctions, does not
care for education without a degree; that the
position of the women, held only by courtesy, was
insecure. A scrupulous examiner might at any
time decline to examine a tripos-candidate whom
he was not bound to examine, and any University
lecturer might refuse to allow women at his lectures.
At the same time, women who "brushed the flounce
of all the sciences," and flitted about like bees for
intellectual honey, might easily pose as University
women and bring real students into disrepute.
Finally: if there <i>were</i> duties as well as privileges
exacted from the children of Alma Mater, women
would hardly be found unwilling to accept them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>Matters came to a crisis at the end of the year
1880. In the winter 1879-1880 (the triposes came,
then, at various periods of the year), Newnham and
Girton obtained first classes in three triposes, the most
conspicuous case being that of Miss C. A. Scott of
Girton, who in the Mathematical Tripos had obtained
(by the usual informal examination) a place equal
to that of the eighth wrangler. These successes
seemed to give a <i>reductio ad absurdum</i> to the common
arguments about the inferiority of the "female
mind," to set the mark of success on the methods
followed at both Colleges, and to suggest the inexpediency&mdash;if
not injustice&mdash;of withholding from
women the title which should give them status and
improve their prospects in the academic world. It
may be mentioned that, in 1878, London University
had obtained a supplement to its Charter empowering
it to admit women to its degrees, a step which
marked both a recognition of the claims of educated
women and an abandonment of London's first
tentative measures in providing examinations for
women. It had for some time admitted women to
a "General Examination," closely resembling the
Matriculation, but allowing more option as to
subjects. This might be followed by examinations
for certificates of Higher Proficiency, which could
be taken, without further fee, with the General, or
in any subsequent year. It was a very useful
examination for girls who had left school and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
continuing their studies at home wished to take up
one subject or another, together or at intervals,
according to convenience. The weak points were
that the syllabus did not sufficiently correspond to
the men's to give any guarantee as to standard
demanded and attained&mdash;and far worse: that there
was nothing progressive about the "Special"
examinations, there being only one examination
held in each subject. When the degree examinations
were thrown open, a good many Cambridge
women took the London B.A. or M.A. <i>after</i> their
triposes in order to have some title to present to
the academic world. But&mdash;as London degrees examinations
were then arranged&mdash;such work generally
involved the consumption of much time on
other than specially chosen lines on the part of any
Cambridge Tripos student. The fact that it was
desired and achieved gave proof&mdash;if fresh proof
were needed&mdash;of the actual market value to educated
women of the letters denoting a certain standard of
mental equipment. London University was then,
it may be added, a University only in name. The
teaching tested in its examinations had been obtained
by solitary students reading privately, by residents
in various provincial Colleges, and by members of
those Colleges in London&mdash;University, King's, Bedford,
and Westfield, which were ready to take their
place as Colleges of an actual teaching as well as
degree-granting University&mdash;as London became in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
1900. The provincial Universities (Manchester,
Birmingham, Bristol, etc.) all admitted women to
their degrees early, if not at their first opening.</p>

<p>But to return to Cambridge. The movement of
1880 was taken up in various quarters, notably in
the North of England. Petitions were drawn up
and sent to the Senate of the University praying
for degrees for women. That originated by Mr.
and Mrs. Aldis of Newcastle declared: "That the
present plan of informal examination is unsatisfactory,
and that consequently the undersigned
persons interested in the Higher Education of
Women pray the Senate of the University to give
women the right of admission to the degree examination
and to degrees." Three other memorials
were presented. The Executive Committee of
Girton College, after pointing to the satisfactory
results of several years' experience, desired the
University to "take their case (that of the Students)
into serious consideration, with a view to their
formal admission to the B.A. degree." This was,
of course, different from the Newcastle petition in
being of the nature of a compromise, since it did
not ask for the M.A. which would have involved a
share in the government of the University. A
similar half-way measure had previously been
adopted with regard to Nonconformists, to whom
the B.A. had been allowed some time before they
were admitted to the M.A.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>The third petition is that which specially interests
us in the history of Newnham College, as it was
that of the Lectures Committee, out of which&mdash;as
already related&mdash;Newnham College took its beginning.
This document, like that of Girton, appeals
to the result of experience, though not to experience
of exactly the same kind. It expresses a desire
that a stable form may be given to the plan of
instruction and examination already being carried
on, and also a preference that some option should
be allowed as to the Previous Examination; and
unwillingness (not refusal) to prepare women for
the Ordinary Degree.</p>

<p>A fourth memorial, much to the same general
purpose as the last, was signed by a hundred and
twenty-three members of the University.</p>

<p>The result of the Memorials was that a Syndicate
was appointed, a memorable discussion on its proposals
held in the Art Schools, and the "Graces"
drawn up to be submitted to the whole Senate.
Among the staunchest supporters of the proposals
were the venerable, whole-hearted helper of the
cause, Prof. Benjamin Hall Kennedy, Dr. (later
Bishop) Browne, Prof. Cayley, Dr. (now Prof.)
H. Jackson, Prof. J. E. B. Mayor, Dr. Peile, and
Mr. Coutts Trotter. These names sufficiently refute
any accusation of youthful flightiness or overstrained
liberalism in the character of the movement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>As the <i>Graces</i> have formed from that time the
basis of Newnham College as an institution sanctioned
by the University, and as their purport is
not always clearly apprehended, it may be as well
to transcribe them in full, excepting only such as
relate to financial and subordinate regulations:</p>

<p>1. Female students who have fulfilled the conditions
respecting length of residence and standing
which Members of the University are required to
fulfil may be admitted to the Previous Examination,
and the Tripos Examinations.</p>

<p>2. Such residence shall be kept (<i>a</i>) at Girton
College or (<i>b</i>) at Newnham College, or (<i>c</i>) within
the precincts of the University under the regulations
of one or other of these Colleges, or (<i>d</i>) in any similar
Institution within the precincts of the University,
which may be recognised hereafter by the University
by Grace of the Senate.</p>

<p>3. Certificates of residence shall be given by the
authorities of Girton College or Newnham College
or other similar institution hereafter recognised by
the University in the same form as that which is
customary in the case of Members of the University.</p>

<p>4. Except as provided in Regulation 5, female
students shall before admission to a Tripos Examination
have passed the Previous Examination (including
the Additional Subjects) or one of the
examinations which excuse Members of the University
from the Previous Examination.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>5. Female students who have obtained an Honour
Certificate in the Higher Local Examination may
be admitted to a Tripos Examination, though such
certificate does not cover the special portions of
the Higher Local Examinations which are accepted
by the University in lieu of parts or the whole of
the Previous Examination; provided that such
students have passed in Group B (Languages) and
Group C (Mathematics).</p>

<p>6. No female student shall be admitted to any
part of any of the Examinations of the University
who is not recommended for admission by the
authorities of the College or other institution to
which she has been admitted.</p>

<p>7. After each examination, a Class List of the
female students who have satisfied the Examiners
shall be published by the Examiners at the same
time with the Class List of Members of the University,
the standard for each Class and the method
of arrangement in each Class being the same in the
two Class Lists.</p>

<p>8. In each class of female students in which the
names are arranged in order of merit, the place
which each of such students would have occupied
in the corresponding Class of Members of the University
shall be indicated.</p>

<p>9. The Examiners for a Tripos shall be at liberty
to state, if the case be so, that a female candidate
shall have failed to satisfy them or has in their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
opinion reached a standard equivalent to that
required from Members of the University for the
Ordinary B.A. degree.</p>

<p>10. To each female student who has satisfied the
Examiners in a Tripos Examination, a Certificate
shall be given by the University stating the conditions
under which she was admitted to the examinations
of the University, the Examinations in
which she has satisfied the Examiner, and the Class
and place in the Class, if indicated, to which she
has attained, in each of such examinations.</p>

<p>It was further provided that these arrangements
should hold, in the first instance, for five years.
Rules were laid down as to the conditions under
which any future Hall of residence might be recognised
by the admission of its students to Triposes.</p>

<p>The result of the voting on the Graces was looked
forward to by both sides with hope and fear. The
result was a triumphant majority for the women's
cause, 331 to 32. The small number who actually
voted against the Graces does not, of course, imply
that the number of objectors was insignificant, for,
in fact, a good many opponents withdrew early as
from a lost cause. From that time, Feb. 24th,
1881, counted as the great day of the College to be
remembered by all succeeding generations of
students, who have been annually reminded at
Commemoration how well their friends had fought
for them, how a special train had been run from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
London to accommodate favourable members of
Parliament, and with what joy and thankfulness
the news had been received in the College and
telegraphed to friends at a distance.</p>

<p>The cause for congratulation was very real. If
things had gone otherwise, it is difficult to see what
the future of women's education in England would
have been. Oxford was temporarily behind Cambridge
in the movement, and a set-back at Cambridge
would certainly have damaged prospects in
the sister University, and, in fact, throughout
England. Women would have been debarred from
sharing in the best that University education in
England can give, and would have been cut off
from the historic sources of sound learning and of
moral and intellectual inspiration.</p>

<p>A perusal of the Graces will show that though
they gave all that was immediately needed, they
did not satisfy all the actual or possible desires of
the promoters of women's colleges. Outsiders, as
before mentioned, already wished for full membership
to be granted. To many this seemed a premature
project. Yet those were right who foresaw that a
desire for more complete membership was certain
to come by and by. In 1881 there were few, if
any, of the women quasi-graduates able to take an
active part in University work. Some apprenticeship,
under the wing of Alma Mater, might seem
at least desirable. Again, the views held by Girton,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
that conditions of examinations such as those
relating to preliminary qualifications and the Pass
degree, ought from the first to have been the same
for women as for members of the University, might
be urged with some force. As already shown, the
objection to compulsory Classics and Mathematics,
even up to the standard of the Previous Examination,
on the part of some of the founders and supporters
of Newnham College was due, not to a
preference for easier conditions, but from a fear of
a detrimental effect on schools. In point of fact,
so many other alternatives than those of the Previous
Examination and the Higher Local are now
offered that neither of these examinations is much
favoured in the best schools that send girls up to
the Universities. As to the Pass Degree: the
suspicion with which it was regarded by the Newnham
pioneers has already been noticed. The
objection to it is not that it is bad in itself: many
attempts have been made to render a pass course
interesting and profitable to men who have not
physical strength or intellectual persistency to
embark on an honours curriculum, or who wish to
reduce their academic duties in order to follow
some social or intellectual hobbies. But there has
always been the danger of demanding a very small
amount of intellectual work and tolerating men
who have no leaning towards academic pursuits,
and to whom the University is chiefly attractive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
by reason of its scope for athletics and for genial
life in comradeship. There was as yet, and it is
to be hoped there will be permanently, no place in
the women's colleges for the society woman without
intellectual aspirations. Such an element would
have been difficult to deal with, and would not
have been successful from any point of view. True,
Newnham never wished to discourage either students
of discursive mind and original ideas and plans, or
those who&mdash;through defective early education or
delicate health&mdash;shrunk from a tripos course. In
fact, some students whose presence and work in
the College have proved eminently beneficial to
themselves and to Newnham, have preferred to
take a mixed course of study. For the rank and
file, it is now supposed that the numerous triposes
afford sufficient choice. If, at the end of her
second year, a student is judged to be unable to
proceed further on tripos lines, she is expected to
go down, unless her studies are judged to be sufficiently
serious and profitable for giving special
leave to continue them. The equivalent of a pass
degree is, as already stated, and as set forth in
No. 9 of the Graces, only awarded to a student who
has narrowly escaped failure. It may also be noticed
that a failure, for a woman, leaves no chance of a
second trial.</p>

<p>The Graces gave a real and substantial benefit to
women students and&mdash;indirectly&mdash;to those who had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
been, informally, through a tripos course at Newnham.
These latter did not obtain University
recognition of any sort, but their names and tripos
places were recorded in the Girton and Newnham
Calendars, and this served as evidence of their
standing to the educational world. When Trinity
College, Dublin, for a few years (as will be hereafter
related) granted an <i>ad eundem</i> B.A. or M.A.
to Oxford and Cambridge women who had taken
final honours examinations, those who had done so
previous to the Graces (as will be hereafter noticed)<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
were admitted with the others. For some reason,
those who many years later drew up the Representation
of the People Act of 1918 felt obliged
to draw the line more strictly and to limit the vote
to those women who had obtained the equivalent
of a degree since 1881.</p>

<p>There were no heart-burnings caused by the comparatively
narrow range of the privileges given by
the Graces, partly because it was always felt that
more would come quietly as time and occasion should
dictate. The resident staff, as such, obtained no
recognition. No woman could sit on a board of
studies, nor lecture formally in an academic building.
Privately, the opinion of Newnham lecturers
was sometimes asked on a question as to curricula,
and women of distinction occasionally lectured and
sometimes drew large audiences, while&mdash;in course
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
of time&mdash;some undergraduates were advised by
their tutors to seek admission to the lectures of a
Newnham specialist. For some years there was no
ground for formal extensions of privilege. And it
was believed, and was to be proved again afterwards,
that in the situation in which Newnham
found itself, it was unwise to demand privileges
that were not almost certain to be granted.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a id="Fig_4"></a>
  <img src="images/i_071.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="medium center">Anne J. Clough</p>
</div>

<p>In fact, the crowning triumph of the Graces marks
the success of the policy of Miss Clough, Dr. and
Mrs. Sidgwick, Miss Kennedy, and the other
founders of the College: a policy of winning great
things by not standing out for lesser ones, of pertinacity
in following a large if at first vague programme,
and of conciliation and "sweet reasonableness"
towards those who looked askance on
the whole movement. It must be observed that all
the Founders were deeply imbued with love and
reverence for the University, and that the students
were brought up to regard it as almost an Alma
Mater&mdash;at any rate, as a noble and worthy corporation,
to which they owed a deep debt for its
past doings, and for what it had always stood for
in the nation and in the world, a debt increased by
the privilege granted to them of living within its
precincts and learning wisdom from its most distinguished
sons. There was no "battering at the
gates." The pioneers of the Women's Colleges, so
far from tolerating any notion that the University<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
would suffer from granting their requests, would
have felt it a thing worth much labour and many
struggles if they could in any way add to the great
repute and dignity which Cambridge had, among
Universities, enjoyed from far-back times.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III<br />

<span class="st">NEWNHAM COLLEGE IN PROGRESS</span></h2>


<p>The time between the recognition of Newnham
College by the University of Cambridge, in 1881,
and the deeply mourned death of its chief founder
and first Principal, in February 1892, is one of
expansion and progress, both as regards the actual
College buildings and the various activities of past
and present students, especially in educational and
social work.</p>

<p>The building of the North Hall has been mentioned,
and also the increase in size of the South
Hall, with the building of a library, not adequate
to the subsequent needs of the College, but sufficient
for the number of students then in residence,
and afterwards very useful as a reading room and
a supplementary library for duplicate books. In
1885 a fives court was erected on the north side of
the College buildings. Meantime, a third Hall was
projected, and, owing to the munificence of various
benefactors, constructed on a liberal scale, and was
ready for opening in 1888. It may be mentioned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
that one benefactor, Mr. Stephen Winkworth, earned
the gratitude of subsequent students by granting a
special sum to provide for the building of students'
rooms of somewhat larger dimensions than the
smaller ones in the other two Halls. Mr. and Mrs.
Winkworth, old friends of Miss Clough, had taken
interest in Newnham from the beginning, and their
only daughter had been a student there.</p>

<p>As we are thus brought to the consideration of
students' rooms, I might mention a line of progress
initiated by the students themselves, and afterwards
followed up by the authorities. In early
days a separate study for each student had not
been contemplated. This is another difference
between Newnham and Girton, since, in the latter
College, the collegiate idea had been more prominent
from the first, and each Girton student had her
bedroom and sitting-room, however small. In the
first abode of Miss Clough and her five students
all slept in <i>bona fide</i> bedrooms and worked sitting
round a common table. In the early Newnham
Hall more arrangement was made for privacy in
study. Each student had her little writing table
and sufficient book-shelves in her room. But the
common sitting-rooms were used for most of the
day, and not many rooms occupied by individual
students were suitable for receiving company.
Even little tea-parties among the students were of
a very picnicky character. But when the ambition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
of the students was set on making a study-bedroom
into a study first and a bedroom in a very secondary
place, ingenuity provided facilities. Although the
matter may seem <i>infiniment petit</i>, I consider that
among Newnham pioneers the two students who
accomplished this revolution should hold a place.
One of them bought a large piece of chintz, and
undisturbed by the jests of some of her comrades
and the amused criticism of Miss Clough, devised a
covering for bedstead, chest of drawers and other
pieces of bedroom furniture. The other, of more
definitely artistic taste (it was in the days of
"Patience" and of the so-called <i>aesthetic</i> movement
for soft colours and flowing lines) procured a
piece of sage-green cloth or cretonne, and effected
a similar revolution. Already in the large corner
rooms something like a cubicle arrangement had
been devised. The evident preference of the
students for harmoniously, if simply, furnished
rooms and for the preponderance of the idea of
study over that of mere rest was followed out in
furnishing new rooms as they were required. Old
oak hutches, bureaux, the drawers of which might
hold clothes, bed-coverings of a character suitable
to that of the room, also pretty wall-papers of the
kind Morris had lately invented, were procured for
the students generally. Thus students came to take
more pleasure in their rooms, into which they could
invite one another, and sometimes friends from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
outside, though the common sitting-rooms were still
the usual place for receiving guests. I think I am
not wrong in saying that Newnham here started a
practice subsequently followed in almost all houses
of residence for women students. Certainly the
first head of Somerville, when visiting Miss Clough,
showed interest in the study-bedroom system. The
desire to make the one room assert its diurnal
rather than its nocturnal character was not new.
Dickens had already ridiculed it in describing the
"rooms" of Dick Swiveller. But the solution of
the problem on principles of both convenience and
beauty was, perhaps, first found in Newnham Hall
during the early days.</p>

<p>I would pass to another&mdash;far more important&mdash;subject
touching the relation of the students to the
building in which they resided: it has puzzled
some people how it has come about that with all
the building, a chapel has never formed part of
Newnham College. The subject is a delicate one,
and I only take it up here because of the very
erroneous and sometimes damaging explanations
that have been assigned for the omission. Worst
of all to those familiar with the leaders of the movement
is the supposition that to them religion was
a matter of indifference. For those who really
knew Miss Clough, and others whom, while they
still live, it seems indecent to mention&mdash;any such
accusation is not only false but absurd. Miss<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
Clough's religion was one that illuminated all her
work and gave her strength and patience to carry
it on. She was, besides, sincerely attached to the
Church of England. At the same time, having
lived in America, and mixed with persons of very
varied religious opinions, she had early become
very widely tolerant of the manifold ways in which
a religious spirit manifests itself in different circles
and different types of character. She had also
seen the bad results of any attempt to force young
people into religious observances which had become
for them unmeaning or distasteful. Again: she
had known vicariously, if not personally, the ferment
of the Tractarian movement at Oxford, and
the wave of scepticism that seemed to follow or
even to accompany it. Also any disposition in her
to avoid whatever might suggest the taking
up of a distinctly denominational or even interdenominational
attitude in the government of the
College was strengthened by the distinctly anti-sectarian
principles of vigorous and powerful supporters.
Possibly at that time, more than at the present,
any definite recognition of religion or provision of
religious services seemed impossible apart from
some denominational bias. The well-meant attempt
of one founder of another women's college to provide
chapel services on undenominational lines had
foundered on the quicksands of theological controversy,
and well-nigh wrecked the College&mdash;till it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
was saved by the singular tact and sympathetic
insight of its new Principal. When Miss Clough
first came to Cambridge, she began, as we have
seen, not with a College, but with a moderate-sized
household, and her arrangements were those of an
ordinary Christian house, including family prayers.
There was no need in Cambridge, as in a country
district, to provide Sunday services. A rule was
laid down, at first, that students were expected to
inform the Principal of the place of worship they
chose to attend, but this proviso was intended
rather to give the Principal the right to make such
inquiry than to impose any restrictions on the
students. Miss Clough always regarded religious
teaching and observance as belonging to the family
rather than to any educational establishment, and
she thought it essential to allow students to keep
up their ties with any church to which they or
their parents might belong.</p>

<p>In some ways the absence of a religious centre to
the College may have been a disadvantage, but if
so, the fault was rather in the times than in any
persons. In point of fact, there has never been
wanting a strong religious element in Newnham
life. At the same time the atmosphere has been
favourable to interchange of religious ideas among
persons of various types and experiences. No
student was made unpopular by her religious views
unless she asserted them in an aggressive way.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
Most religious movements in Cambridge (and there
have been many) since the beginnings of the College
have made their influence felt within its precincts,
and a large number of past students have devoted
their lives to distinctly religious work, especially in
distant lands, and such always look to the staff
and students of their College for sympathy and
encouragement.</p>

<p>This digression seemed necessary to correct prevalent
misconceptions. To return to the general
growth of the College in the eighties: attached to
the new Hall of residence as its dining-hall was a
beautiful College Hall, much larger than either of
the other dining-rooms, and suggestions were made
that the Staff with the students in all three Halls
should dine together. This arrangement was, however,
not easily compatible with the plan of division
for tutorial purposes into three Halls. One desirable
addition was a well-equipped kitchen. For a
time the two Halls on the north side were supplied
from the new kitchen; but much later, when the
new Hall to the west, Peile Hall, was built, a large
central kitchen was constructed, and all four Halls
were provided from it, the food being wheeled to
each in covered trolleys and received on hot tables
in the several Halls.</p>

<p>The opening of Clough Hall, as the new and
largest Hall was named, was a great occasion for
Newnham. It was a pleasant summer day (June<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
9th, 1888), and many friends came from a distance.
On the same day a degree was to be granted to
the son of the Prince of Wales (Prince Albert Victor),
and the Prince of Wales (Edward VII.) with the
Princess and the three young Princesses paid a
visit to the College. The students welcomed them
with song in the new dining-hall, a ballot having
first been taken among them as to who were the
best representative students to present bouquets.
This is probably the first and last occasion on
which, in Newnham, a critical decision had to be
made as to beauty, physical vigour and becoming
dress. The royal party walked across the garden
from the new Hall to the Principal's own rooms.
Next followed a delightful ceremony which betokened
both the respect and affection felt for one
of the most assiduous helpers of the College and
the beginnings of a new vista for Newnham in the
endowment of Research&mdash;the presentation to Miss
Marion Kennedy of a sum, which her friends had
raised, to found a Studentship bearing her name,
as an endowment for post-graduate work. There
had been since 1882, by the generosity of the Hon.
Selina Bathurst, a fund for encouraging advanced
work in Natural Science, and it seemed eminently
fitting that the possibility of promoting learning of
any kind should be associated with the revered
name of Kennedy. But perhaps the most moving
event of that day was almost unpremeditated.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
The old students who had come from a distance,
with those in residence, had a social supper in the
large new Hall, after which Miss Clough, overcoming
the reticence with which she habitually
covered her deepest feelings, allowed all present to
see more of her ideals and hopes, with her trust in
their realization, than some of them had as yet
known to be part of her character.</p>

<p>The new buildings necessitated a new nomenclature.
The points of the compass were rejected
in favour of the names of the founders. North
Hall, which had been inaugurated by Mrs. Sidgwick's
Vice-Principalship, became Sidgwick Hall,
the new Hall was named Clough Hall, the South
Hall&mdash;not being connected with any founder so
intimately as with Miss Clough herself&mdash;retained a
portion of its prestige in the title of the Old Hall.
Other names of founders and benefactors were
reserved for later additions to the College. Miss
Clough herself took up residence in the Hall which
bore her name. Miss Gladstone was still Vice-Principal
in Sidgwick Hall; Miss Jane Lee, a very
earnest scholar of Italian literature, entirely devoted
to the best interests of the College, became head of
the Old Hall, also with the title of Vice-Principal.
This title for the person presiding over one particular
Hall, and giving special attention to the
needs of the students in that Hall, became somewhat
misleading, and has since been replaced by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
that of Tutor, to which (in the Cambridge Colleges)
it roughly corresponds. The Vice-Principal in each
Hall had much more to do with house-keeping
arrangements than later on, when more unity in
this respect had been achieved and a regular Steward
appointed. The Vice-Principals presided at table
in their several Halls, corresponded with the parents
of students, arranged, within the limits of a few
simple laws, rules for the discipline of the students,
read prayers in the morning; in fact, were generally
responsible for the social, physical and moral
requirements of the students. As, when there were
only two Halls, Miss Gladstone held the office in
Sidgwick Hall for many years, she imparted to it
a certain character, and for a long time <i>the</i> V.-P.
was a title regarded as almost individual to her.
The separation into Halls, inevitable for a time,
had, in Miss Clough's estimation and perhaps in
reality, a very decided advantage. Students in one
Hall naturally saw more of one another than of
those in other Halls; Old Hall especially was somewhat
cut off from the two others, so long as the
public road ran between. And for games, clubs, and
other social purposes, it was often a help to have
a natural division into the three Halls. The larger
societies&mdash;such as the Debating Society, the Musical
Society, and some others, as well as the more regular
of the Games Clubs&mdash;belonged to the College as a
whole. The teaching arrangements were, of course,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
always made for the whole College and not separately
for each Hall.</p>

<p>From about this time the social activities of the
students, both those resident in College and those
who had gone back to their own homes or taken up
definite work, showed themselves in many ways.
In 1880 an effort was made to keep up in those who
had gone down the College spirit and College interests.
The result was a society called the Newnham College
Club, rather an unfortunate name, since it was not
a club properly so-called, having no local habitation;
it sometimes became confounded with the
Ladies' University Club, and students were debarred
from entering by the fear of expense. The "Club"
prepared students' minds for the official College
Roll which superseded it in 1919. The founders
and officers of the Club (among whom those especially
active in its initiation and development were
Miss Julia Sharpe, Miss Olive Macmillan (Mrs.
MacLehose), Mrs. Corrie Grant (<i>née</i> Adams), deserve
the gratitude of the College for having, by means
of an annual <i>Newnham Letter</i>, with information as
to College developments, births, marriages, deaths
among old students, fresh appointments, etc., and
by regular meetings in London, kept alive in a
large and growing number of former students the
memory of their Alma Mater and her interest in
the doings of her children. In after times it
was interesting to see how, when a member of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
the Club who had gone to live in Central Africa or
New Zealand visited her old haunts, she was found
to be far better informed as to the lines of recent
progress than some who had never left England.</p>

<p>In another direction Newnham took the lead,
this time on the direct initiation of Miss Clough, in
the formation of a teachers' agency for qualified
women who had taken a College course. The
governesses' agencies of those days opened their
doors to stronger and to feebler applicants. Heads
of schools and families desiring well-educated
teachers were constantly writing to Miss Clough,
and it seemed time to start a registry on collegiate
lines. She communicated the project to a few
former students engaged or interested in education,
and they at once formed a committee, invited the
co-operation of Girton, the Oxford Colleges, and
the graduated women of London University, and
started what became the Association of University
Women Teachers. From ten or a dozen members
it has increased to over 2800. The idea of this
Society, as compared with the ordinary registry,
was that the Secretary, a University woman and
in close touch with Universities, should keep herself
personally informed as to the credentials and
careers of applicants; that she should make sure
of the eligibility of the posts offered; and that she
should be able to offer advice to young teachers as
to applying for posts and making changes when,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
but not before, it seemed expedient; and that the
expenses should, as far as possible, be defrayed
from the ordinary subscriptions of members.
Further, and this was a point of much importance,
it was intended that the Association should watch
over the interests of women teachers, and should
interest itself in educational questions generally.
The secretaryship has been held by various University
women&mdash;for many years by Miss Alice Gruner,
whose experience and untiring devotion to the
work made her a most valuable adviser both to
those who offered and those who were seeking
educational posts. It is now filled by Mrs. Brough
(<i>née</i> Lloyd), and has offices at 108 Victoria Street,
Westminster.</p>

<p>Miss Clough never lost her interest in school
teaching and teachers, of any and all types. At
one time she arranged for parties of Newnham
students to visit some of the elementary schools in
Cambridge and give amateur lessons&mdash;chiefly that
they might know what the inside of an elementary
schoolroom was like&mdash;partly because, as she entirely
believed, education and mutual acquaintance are
the great factors for breaking down class distinctions.
Meantime, a body of energetic Newnham
students (led by Miss E. P. Hughes, Miss A. M.
Adams and others) were eager to help in the education
of working men. For many years a school was
kept up in St. Matthew's Schoolroom, Barnwell,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
for men who were known not to go to church on
Sunday mornings, but who wished, during those
hours, to learn some of the elements which&mdash;in
those days&mdash;many adults had never acquired.
Miss Clough was much interested in the scheme,
and once or twice came down to speak to the men,
though she was anxious that no student should, in
taking part in the work, give up time that she
required for Sunday rest. The school was for
some years vigorously carried on by the late Principal,
Miss Stephen. While it lasted, it certainly
did good work on both sides. The classes were
conversational, and many students learned at least
something of working men's life and ambitions.
It died down partly owing to the irregularity necessitated
by the alternation of terms and vacations,
partly to the activities of a new clergyman, who
was not without hope of inducing men to go to
church on Sunday mornings.</p>

<p>The interest which Miss Clough always felt, and
which she imparted to a good many students, in
elementary teachers and their work was shown in
certain experiments, novel as they seemed then,
though precursive of greater things. She was
anxious that those teachers who had a hard and
often a dull life, and whom she knew to be often
most conscientious and zealous in their profession,
should see something of a different life, and especially
of University life, and in particular that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
should enjoy some rambles among the old Colleges
of Cambridge, and hear lectures from Cambridge
teachers. The Summer Meeting of the Extension
Scheme was not as yet, unless one counts it as
beginning in these Newnham gatherings. Certainly
it originated in the circle of educational pioneers to
which Miss Clough belonged, and some of the earliest
"Extension Students" were successors to those who
had come up under the early scheme. In the
summer of 1885 two men and two women from the
northern counties (the women being both elementary
teachers) received bursaries from the Lectures
Association in the north that they might come for
three or four weeks' study in Cambridge. The
women were accommodated in Newnham, and
though their teaching had been otherwise provided
for, Miss Clough commended them to the care of
some of the younger lecturers, who did the chaperoning
required in those more exacting days, and gave
what social and friendly help was required. In
1887 Miss Clough undertook a similar experiment
on her own account. A party of about fourteen
women teachers in elementary schools were accommodated
for three weeks in the Red Houses which
formed the interim abode of students while Clough
Hall was in process of building and were not required
during the Long Vacation. In 1889 and 1891 the
experiment was repeated, the teachers being received
into the Old Hall. Certain of the younger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
lecturers gave them lectures in History and Literature,
and in some of the subjects (Latin, Logic,
etc.) with which they were struggling for their
examinations, while the Natural Science lecturers
took several of them into the laboratories and for
botanical excursions. The lecturers and students
of Newnham acted up to the College reputation for
hospitality, and Miss Clough herself visited them
and invited them to see her in her private room.
The grievances of teaching in the days of half-time
pupils and dearth of money and books for teachers
were poured into sympathetic ears. After the
Annual Summer Meeting of University Extension
Students had been fairly set on foot these sectional
meetings became merged in the general one, and
there was no need for such special gatherings at
Newnham, but the College, when the Meeting was
in Cambridge, has always received a number of
Extension Students as paying guests, and lecturers
and other Newnham officials have taken pains to
make the visit profitable, so that many came year
after year and always cherished an affection for
Newnham above and beyond that which they felt
for Cambridge.</p>

</div>

<p>This movement was one from above&mdash;originated
by the Principal and worked mainly by the Staff.
But the one which brought Newnham generally most
closely into contact with what one may call socio-educational
work was the Women's University<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
Settlement in Southwark. The idea of "settlements"
is familiar nowadays, and the original character and
object of such institutions has much changed and
developed since the first experiment was begun by
the inspiration and intense activity of Arnold
Toynbee. The primary notion of a <i>settlement</i> was
of an abode in the poorer districts of a town where
men of culture, engaged in various occupations,
might make their home, devoting their leisure to
the society and to the amusement or assistance of
poorer neighbours. While this ideal is more or less
preserved in the numerous settlements&mdash;some connected
with particular churches or colleges, others
quite independent&mdash;to be found in London and in
others of our big towns, perhaps the possibility of
uniting outside professional duties in the daytime
with attention to social evils and their remedies in
the evenings has not been permanently realized in
any. Certainly in Settlements of women, the self-regarding
part of the work has become chiefly
educational: the training of the worker by instruction
in the principles of economics and the
history of social legislation. The Settlement in
Southwark was throughout of this description.
Though it has been carried on by women from other
Universities as well as Cambridge women, the first
thought of such an enterprise arose in Cambridge
after an interesting meeting of the Society for
Discussing Social Questions. This society of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
Cambridge ladies, including Girton and Newnham
students (founded chiefly by the efforts of Mrs.
Marshall), held, Feb. 4th, 1887, an interesting
meeting at which Mrs. Samuel Barnett, wife of the
Warden of Toynbee Hall, and Miss Alice Gruner&mdash;lately
a historical student of Newnham College&mdash;read
interesting papers on <i>Settlements</i>. Miss Gruner
had already begun work of the kind in London and
was anxious to find helpers. Several students were
inspired to initiate a Settlement; Miss Gruner
consented to allow her undertaking to be taken
over as the nucleus and became the first Warden.
Girton was appealed to and also the Oxford Halls.
The result was the formation of a Committee and
the acquiring of a house in Nelson Square, London,
S.E., Miss Gruner having laid her finger on the
very spot afterwards marked most darkly in Sir
C. Booth's <i>Life and Labour of the People</i>. The
history of the Settlement, the development of its
various activities, the links which it formed with
other agencies, religious and secular, in combining
for the betterment of conditions among the London
poor, the schemes adopted by its residents and
afterwards taken up by public authorities, do not
belong, except indirectly, to the history of Newnham
College, yet the Settlement has certainly been
a factor in the life of many students, and it is not
too much to say that what was first discussed
within the walls of Newnham has been successfully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
worked out in many parts of England and, indeed,
in some distant lands. Many University women
besides Newnham students have worked there, and
one may suppose that in a sense the movement
was "in the air" and would in any case have come
into active existence. Yet Newnham may enjoy
some of the credit of the work done in Southwark
and of the excellent Wardens provided in the
persons of Miss Gruner, Miss Sewell, Miss Gladstone,
and the present head, Miss M. M. Sharpley.
Workers and officers of much devotion and ability
have been supplied by Oxford and the London
University, and Settlements of a somewhat similar
kind form adjuncts to other Universities, such as
Bristol, Leeds and Birmingham.</p>

<p>If Newnham was making its way, as learner, as
teacher, and as worker, in the field of social
enterprise, the same is even more true in
that of education. A large proportion of the
students during the time now under consideration
adopted the teaching profession. Technical
training was not insisted on by head mistresses,
nor by the Government, and most young
women plunged into educational life to sink
or swim&mdash;some of those who might have sunk
emerging after a term or two to take a course of
training. The head for many years of the Maria
Grey Training College was a University woman
(Miss Alice Woods of Girton) and the first head of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
the Cambridge Training College was from Newnham&mdash;Miss
E. P. Hughes. Meantime, the standard
of attainment in girls' schools was rapidly rising,
as women who had received a University education
took up posts in them and imbued their pupils with
a desire to come up some day to Cambridge. At
first, former students had often to work as assistants
under Heads of a different and older type, but this
was not always a disadvantage, as the older, partly
self-taught, mistresses, both of public and private
schools, sometimes showed an admirable power
of blending the new life which young University
teachers brought into the schools with
the good traditions of the last generation. In
course of time head mistresses were generally
appointed from assistants who had a good "degree
or its equivalent," and the bonds between schools
and the University thus became stronger.</p>

<p>In 1890 the College had again a festive occasion&mdash;on
the attainment by Miss Philippa Fawcett of a
place in the Mathematical Tripos above the Senior
Wrangler. The scene in the Senate-house is one
that will live in the memory of all who were present.
It is pleasant to be able to say that no discordant
note was struck. As Miss Fawcett passed out,
with Miss Clough leaning on her arm, the undergraduates
formed a line on either side and gave a
hearty cheer. The event was celebrated at Newnham
by a dinner in Hall, at which Mrs. Fawcett was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
present, and also Dr. Hobson, Miss Fawcett's tutor in
mathematics. In the evening her student friends
decorated the doorway with lamps, and as there was
just then a piece of waste ground at the west-end of
the College grounds, it was possible to make a bonfire,
and to carry the Senior Wrangler round it, and
in the light of the fire to call on Dr. Hobson for a
speech. Miss Clough was quietly happy, and all
present felt that there was something of poetical
justice in the occurrence. Professor and Mrs.
Fawcett had been, as we have seen, pioneers in the
movement for women's education; they had also
been warmly attached to Miss Clough, as, in a more
filial way, their daughter had been for many years.
Miss Fawcett herself, besides being one to whose
brilliant mathematical powers the highest academic
honours were due, was a singularly suitable person
for this high distinction, in that she exemplified so
many of the qualities popularly supposed to be
absent from the character of a University woman.
She was modest and retiring, almost to a fault&mdash;trying
though not always successfully, to counteract
the impression made by her personality, so as to
appear like a very ordinary person&mdash;not known to
many, but loved as well as admired by her intimate
friends. As the subsequent career of Miss Fawcett
is not well known, it may be stated here that after
the second and more advanced part of the Mathematical
Tripos (in which she obtained the highest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
honours) she held for a year the Marion Kennedy
Studentship already referred to, and wrote on a
problem involving advanced mathematical research.
She subsequently acted as Mathematical Lecturer
at Newnham, but feeling, as her father had felt
before her, the call of national service above all
inducement to academic pursuits, she accepted a
Government appointment and went out to help
organize education in the Transvaal. After a period
of assiduous work in Johannesburg, she returned to
England and was appointed a Principal Assistant
in the Education Department of the London County
Council, a post of much importance and responsibility.
Miss Fawcett served for some years on the
Council of Newnham College, and has maintained a
constant interest in its welfare.</p>

<p>To return to the history of the College: in
February 1892 it had to sustain a loss which was
hardly less a blow from having come in the ordinary
course of nature. Miss Clough was 72 years old in
the January of that year. She had to most people
looked about the same age for many years, as her
hair had whitened early, and the vivid look in her
eyes never suggested old age. The portrait of her
by Shannon, painted in 1890, gives a better impression
of her than Richmond's portrait of 1882.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
The latter shows, perhaps, more strength, the
former more sweetness. But neither can possibly
give an adequate interpretation to a face so speaking
and changeful. Shannon's is a sympathetic
study of calm, benevolent, but alert old age, suggestive
of ripe experience and of a patient outlook
on life. It hangs in the College Hall with the
portraits of Prof. and Mrs. Sidgwick and Miss
Kennedy, all of them pleasing and profitable reminders
to the students, at their meals, debates,
and dancing, of the character as well as the appearance
of those to whom they owe their present happy
opportunities.</p>

<p>During the later part of her life Miss Clough had
been obliged to let some of her work be lightened,
and to give the management of Clough Hall to
Miss Katharine Stephen, who had formerly been
Miss Gladstone's secretary; but she still kept an
eye on everything that happened in the College,
and many things far beyond. Miss Clough had
always felt a deep interest in the colonies, and she
kept up a correspondence with past students who
had made educational ventures in many distant
parts. As one of them said, "her interest in us
seemed to vary directly as the squares of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
distances," though certainly those nearer to Cambridge
would not have accepted such a formula.
Such schemes as the mixed education for blacks
and whites in Jamaica, the starting of a loan library
in tropical Australia, the opening of a boarding-school
for aristocratic girls in Siam, aroused her
warm interest and often called forth wholesome
advice as well as sympathy. She was always able
to enjoy a quiet country holiday in vacation time.
The pleasures of friendship brought her comfort and
enjoyment all her life, during the latter part of
which she had the companionship of her niece&mdash;daughter
of the brother to whom she had owed so
much in her early intellectual development&mdash;and
much care and solicitude from some of the lecturers
and of the elder students. She may be said
to have died in harness. The last time that she
appeared at a meeting for students was to interest
them in Mr. Morant's educational efforts in Siam.
One of the last visitors from abroad whom she
received, lying on a sitting-room couch, was a lady
from Australia who could bring tidings of a University
hostel managed by a former student. Miss
Clough was not sure that this student was working
on the best lines, and was anxious to hear about
her and to send her a message of kindly warning.</p>

<p>The end came quietly on February 27th, 1892.
To very many it seemed as if the world could never
be quite the same without her. Certainly the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
College, however wisely and generously conducted,
was bound to follow new courses. Yet in a sense
Miss Clough was <i>felix opportunitate mortis</i>. She
had lived to see her work set on a stable footing;
she might safely leave it in the hands of those
like-minded with herself; and she was spared the
pain of friction and later of bitter opposition which
the College and its promoters had to suffer in seeking
a permanent place within University borders.</p>

<p>Miss Clough's kinsfolk showed great breadth of
mind, generosity, and appreciation of her own
desires and feelings, in arranging that the funeral
should be rather of a collegiate than of a family
character. She had expressed a wish that her
remains should rest in a churchyard rather than a
cemetery, and as she possessed a little property in
the parish of Grantchester, the burial was in the
pleasant ground attached to the church there. A
simple slab was afterwards erected with name,
date, and the words: "After she had served her
generation by the will of God, she fell on sleep."
The first part of the service was, by the kind offer
of the Provost and Fellows of King's College, read
in the beautiful chapel of that College, the services
of which had been to her, for many years, a perpetual
solace and aid. The Staff of Newnham
walked behind the coffin. The Chapel was crowded
with members of the University and a great number
of former students from all parts of England. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
following Sunday (the First in Lent) it fell to Dr.
Ryle (now Dean of Westminster) to preach a sermon,
and the subject suited to the season and also to
Miss Clough's character and work suggested his
text: "Endure hardness, as a good soldier of
Jesus Christ." His reference was very appreciative
and delicate. Perhaps it might have struck some
hearers that though Miss Clough would have
thoroughly appreciated the idea of service in the
Christian army, she might not have considered that
she had "endured hardness" as much as many
others. Her strenuous efforts and personal restrictions
were so entirely dictated by the needs of
her cause and of the individuals in her charge, that
there was no place for asceticism in her life,
though much for plain living and high thinking.</p>

<p>The figure of Miss Clough must necessarily look
large in the history of Newnham College, since she
was both its principal founder and its first head.
But it would be useless labour to compare her with
other founders and heads. Her objects and her
way of obtaining them were peculiar to herself in
her particular <i>milieu</i>. When she was removed,
others who had supported her were ready to follow
up her work, perhaps on more consistently stated
principles, with somewhat more of theory in the
background. But there were some ideas at the basis
of the College recognised only by those who had
caught her spirit, either by working under her in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
life or by imbibing the moral and intellectual
atmosphere which for a long time has kept the
College sound and wholesome. The mental and
moral debt of the present College to her, and to
those one may call her disciples, has been more or
less manifest already, and will appear more evident
in the sequel.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV<br />

<span class="st">NEWNHAM COLLEGE IN PROGRESS, 1892-1911&mdash;PRINCIPALSHIP
OF MRS. SIDGWICK.</span></h2>


<p>The loss of Miss Clough seemed to remove the
College from its early&mdash;one might say heroic&mdash;period
to the regions of ordinary history. Yet
there was something uncommon in the circumstances
under which her successor was appointed.
At the Council Meeting after Miss Clough's death,
a strong wish was expressed that Mrs. Sidgwick,
who had already once given up, with her husband,
the privacy of home life, might be induced to become
the second Principal. Newnham wanted them,
and they came; making, as one would expect, the
very least of any personal inconvenience involved
in once more giving up their house. As Sidgwick
said to a friend,<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> "What we feel most strongly is
that after Miss Clough's death it is the duty of all
who have given their minds to Newnham to 'close
ranks,' and take the place that others assign to
one. We hope it will be for the good of the College."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>
<p>For a short time Mrs. Sidgwick was obliged
to live a divided life, part at Hillside, part at
Newnham. But in December 1893 the Principal's
new quarters were ready, and she and her husband
moved into them.</p>

<p>These new quarters had been partly provided by
a very timely bequest. A short time before, Mrs.
Emily Pfeiffer, the poetess, and her husband,
visited Cambridge, and were much pleased with
what they saw of Newnham and with the hospitality
of Miss Clough. Mrs. Pfeiffer died soon after,
and her husband did not long survive her. Their
money was left in great part to societies and buildings
for the benefit of women, and of this the sum
of £5000 was adjudged to Newnham College. There
were some legal difficulties, soon overcome, but a
hindrance remained in the fact already mentioned,
that a public pathway divided Sidgwick Hall with
Clough Hall from the Old Hall.</p>

<p>What was desired was to connect the two parts
of the College by a block of buildings containing
students' rooms, and, as finally arranged, a suite
of rooms for the Principal, a set of small lecture or
"coaching" rooms, a large room for the Staff, to
serve as a kind of Combination Room, and a Porter's
Lodge. This could not be done without closing the
public foot-path. Fortunately, a new carriage road
parallel to the former foot-path was greatly needed
for communication between the town and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
country beyond the College. Such a road, if made,
would compensate the public for the loss of the
foot-path. Newnham College was naturally willing
enough to give up a strip along the north side of
its grounds as a contribution to the road. But
others were less willing to give up portions of their
ground, without which the scheme could not have
been carried through. After much discussion, a
very satisfactory solution was reached. A broad
road, now called <i>Sidgwick Avenue</i>, was made, largely
at the expense of Professor and Mrs. Sidgwick,
with some help from other friends, and the path
was closed. There was a curious interregnum,
after the dividing fences of the Hall gardens had
been removed and before the path had become
private, during which tradesmen's boys used to
loiter, basket on head, as they passed through to
the Grange Road, and watch the students' games
at hockey or tennis. When Sidgwick Avenue was
complete and the path closed, this anomaly naturally
ceased.</p>

<p>In the archway under Pfeiffer Building, forming
the main entrance to the College, were placed a pair
of beautiful bronze gates. These were presented
by past and present students, in memory of Miss
Clough. They bear the Clough Arms, and the
decoration is a combination of floral and foliate.
The designer was the architect of all the College
buildings, Mr. Basil Champneys. It was said at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
the preliminary meeting that in future every student
would have Miss Clough brought to her mind on
her first entry into the College and her departure
from it. Unfortunately this cannot be carried out in
practice, for though the Gates are the only means of
ingress or egress after dark and form the principal
entrance to the College as a whole, there are other
entrances to three of the Halls which are used by
day.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a id="Fig_6"></a>
  <img src="images/i_107.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="medium center">NEWNHAM COLLEGE&mdash;THE ENTRANCE GATES.</p>
</div>

<p>Thus the suite of rooms above the Memorial
Gates formed the dwelling-house of Professor and
Mrs. Sidgwick, a somewhat inadequate "Master's
Lodge" for a large and rising College, but pleasant
in outlook and sufficient in size for all immediate
requirements. Needless to say, the hospitable
traditions of Hillside were maintained at Newnham,
and members of the Staff had opportunities of
occasionally meeting very interesting guests who
came from far and near.</p>

<p>The Principal's life was a full one. Besides being
Principal of the College she was its Bursar&mdash;an
office which she only resigned at the end of 1919,
to the regret of those who realized how much the
financial success of the College has owed to her
care and thought. Careful and even abstemious in
all personal expenditure, she was always ready to
entertain suggestions of new ventures. But besides
this, she kept an eye on everything that happened
in the College. She took all opportunities of coming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
to know the students personally, by frequently
dining in hall, inviting students to her drawing-room
and to breakfast, attending debates and little
entertainments, and by making the College, both
during her husband's lifetime and afterwards, an
evidently large factor in her life. His presence,
while he lived in the background, was always a help
and a stimulus. If he made sacrifices in giving up
his private house, he made many more in the time
he devoted to the College at large and to students
in particular. But with him and his wife, as with
the first Principal, such sacrifices were so much
the order of the day as hardly to be recognized
as such, and were only fully appreciated in later
years.</p>

<p>One sacrifice made by Mrs. Sidgwick for the good
of the College was the restriction of the time she
could now give to the work of the Society for
Psychical Research. She maintained the interest
she and her husband had long felt in the Society,
and took part in its meetings and various proceedings.
But she never encouraged such interest
among the students, since she knew how many
unsteady heads have been turned by a superstitious
dabbling in the occult. It would be difficult to
over-estimate the advantage to the Society of
having persons of such complete sanity and scrupulous
balance of mind as the Sidgwicks among the
investigators.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>We have noticed as one of the additions to the
College in connection with the Pfeiffer Building a
Combination Room for the Staff, including all
women Lecturers and resident Fellows. Later on
its functions were transferred to its present quarters,
the room next the College Dining Hall&mdash;a pleasant
room with two fireplaces and a door opening on the
garden&mdash;the original Combination Room being made
use of partly as a committee room, partly as a
reading and coaching room for students.</p>

<p>Work among both students and past students
had meantime been facilitated by the gift in 1898
of a well-designed library building, for which the
College has to thank the liberality of Mr. and
Mrs. Yates Thompson. The Library is admirably
adapted to its purpose, with section recesses divided
off by bookcases and conveniently arranged tables,
while beauty of proportion, the excellence of the
woodwork, and the elaborate mouldings on the
ceiling (of the principal Printers' Arms of the sixteenth
century) give it an artistic as well as academic
character. When (1907) nearly ten years after its
opening, its space proved insufficient for the books
belonging to the College, the same benefactors most
generously doubled it in size, providing staircases
and a fine east window.</p>

<p>The supply of library books grew and prospered
at least in proportion to the general progress of the
College. Many of the original promoters were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
literary men and book-lovers, and their gifts and
bequests, besides the money annually spent out of
the College income, made the necessary extension
just noticed necessary, and tended to make the
College a more desirable place for old students&mdash;especially
such as were engaged in educational or
literary work&mdash;in which to spend part of the summer
vacation. Some friends were anxious that the
Library should have interesting books of a non-special
character. Mrs. Stephen Winkworth,
already mentioned, whenever she had enjoyed
some new work of biography or general literature,
used to send a copy of it for the Newnham Library.
Mr. Coutts Trotter, Miss Clough's kind adviser in
the early days, bequeathed the bulk of his books
to Newnham College. The same was done by
Mary Bateson, of whom we shall have more to say
presently. There never was a time when there
was not an influx of books of various kinds. Provision
was made for a steady supply by the
assignment to the Library Committee every year of
a sum proportional to the number of students. Most
books, on conditions, might be taken out for parts
of the vacations. The Library Committee consists
of representatives on the Staff of all the principal
subjects studied and other lecturers, whose duty it
is to submit the names of books required by the
students whom they direct. The Library has thus
been kept up to date, and has also continually been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
enriched by special gifts. Thus a Dante Library
was formed in memory of Miss Jane Lee, already
mentioned; a clock was given by a generation of
students going down, the case being designed by
one of them; guests gave books on their departure.
The catalogues were carefully kept, and if any slackness
in returning books was observed, great vigilance
was used to recall them. The care of the Library
was for many years in the hands of Miss Katharine
Stephen.</p>

<p>It had been the wish of early friends&mdash;especially
of Miss Kennedy&mdash;to attach permanently to the
College as many as possible of the past students.
This had been done to a certain extent, as already
shown, by the Newnham College Club. Another
plan, still adhered to, is to invite all students who
belonged to specified periods, to come up to Commemoration
Dinner on or about February 24th&mdash;a
practice more or less observed in the Colleges of
the University. But in addition it was the aim of
the founders to bring the old students into the
Constitution, so that the responsibility for the
College should eventually be to a greater extent in
their hands. With this object in view, the Constitution
was revised, and in 1893 a new body of
members was created chosen from the old students
and called Associates (not Associate Members, who
were a separate class of members qualified by subscriptions).
In this year all past students were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
requested to send in the names of those twenty
among their College contemporaries or friends
whom they considered most fitted to aid the causes
of "Education, learning, and research." To the
first twenty who obtained the greatest number of
votes the Council added ten, and the number was
increased by annual election of three till it reached
48, after which time three were to resign every year
and three others to be chosen by co-optation. The
Associates were full members of the College, and
as such took part in the election of the Council,
and still, under the later Constitution, elect members
of the Governing Body. They meet in Cambridge
every year, and coming as they do from various
centres, contribute new ideas and points of view.
At first, as might naturally be expected, most of
the resident Staff were placed on the list. It
includes many women who have reached some degree
of eminence in their several lines of activity and
also usually some research fellows.</p>

<p>There was in these years a growing desire to
provide opportunities for what may be called post-graduate
work, though the term is not strictly
applicable. There had been, as we have seen,
students doing advanced work before the foundation
of any research fellowships. The studentship
connected with the name of Miss Marion Kennedy
had given opportunity for a successful Tripos
student to look about her, try some manageable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
piece of work, and either find some fresh line to
follow up in the field of science or letters, or else
enter the teaching profession with a wider view of
her functions than could generally be found in one
who had never advanced in her studies beyond the
undergraduate stage. Studentships in the Natural
Sciences were, from 1881, awarded from time to
time to students of post-graduate status from the
Bathurst Fund already mentioned. But something
involving a longer period of independent
study was clearly desirable. Critics of the women's
education movement were wont to assert that
women might do fairly well in Triposes and in
educational work afterwards, but that they contributed
nothing of any significance to the advancement
of knowledge. This "hasty generalization"
needed removing. It was, however, no mere spirit
of feminine rivalry, but a generous impetus to
labour in intellectual fields, to satisfy one's own
thirst for truth, and to help in the building up of
the sciences&mdash;whether natural or human&mdash;that inspired
the promoters and labourers in this new field
of College activity. The most eager and influential
in this movement was a member of the College
eminently marked by a keen delight in research
for its own sake, and by a desire that Newnham
should be able to hold its own in the highest kind
of University work among all the Colleges of the
world&mdash;Mary Bateson. Under her influence the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
first research fellowship was given by Mrs. Herringham,
and was thrown open to public application in
1900. Friends of the College and the students
themselves were stirred up to raise funds for more
research fellowships. The number is now four, and
they are awarded by a special committee and tenable
for three years. The stipend was originally sufficient
to pay the expenses of a woman resident in
the College, though a small amount of lecturing or
tuition was held to be compatible with the duties
of the fellow.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> The first Newnham students to hold
a research fellowship were Miss J. E. Harrison and
Miss G. L. Elles (1900). The former had already
acquired celebrity by her archaeological works&mdash;especially
her <i>Myths and Monuments of Ancient
Athens</i>&mdash;and had been invited to occupy rooms in
Newnham, where she speedily created a keen
interest among students and many of the Staff,
first in classical archaeology and later in anthropology.
Miss Elles is well known as a geologist,
and had already been teaching at the Sedgwick
Museum under Professor Hughes.</p>

<p>With the research fellowships it has been possible
to retain at Newnham advanced students
whose researches have made a solid contribution to
knowledge. Though it may seem invidious to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
make a selection, mention may be made of the
researches of Miss E. R. Saunders (partly in co-operation
with Mr. Bateson) into the laws of Variation;
the study of floral pigments by Miss Wheldale
(Mrs. Onslow); that of animal psychology by Miss
E. M. Smith (Mrs. Bartlett); and in widely different
fields, Miss Maud Sellers' valuable work in rescuing
and making public the records of the Merchant
Adventurers of York; that of Miss Paues, in
unearthing a Middle-English Bible; Mrs. Temperley's
(<i>née</i> Bradford) studies in Tudor Proclamations
and other legal antiquities; and, not least,
the wide range of Miss Mary Bateson's work
in Mediaeval History, chiefly monastic and municipal.</p>

<p>Mary Bateson was so much the prime mover in
the development of Newnham work for the advancement
of learning, and some of the teachers who
stimulated and directed her efforts were so evidently
epoch-making in the lives of Newnham students;
also her tragically sudden death in 1906 cut short
such a remarkably promising career and evoked so
much sympathy with Newnham throughout the
University, that a few more words may be devoted
to keeping her memory fresh. Her father (Master
of St. John's College) and her mother&mdash;much distinguished
in her zealous efforts for the betterment
of women&mdash;were old friends of Miss Clough and the
College; her elder brother, Mr. William Bateson, is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
well known for his remarkable work on heredity.
Mary Bateson began independent research in the
Monastic Civilisation of the Fens, even before she
took the Historical tripos, in which she naturally
obtained a good first class. Her literary activity
in the production of articles for learned periodicals,
and later very substantial books, was immense. At
the same time, her zeal in the cause of her own
College never faltered. For many years she was
ready to do what teaching was offered to her on
her own lines, and she did it exceedingly well. But
her great task in the College was to produce a noble
discontent. She cared far less that the students
should take good places in their examinations than
that they should come to understand what sound
learning really means, and should share her own
delight in the search for undiscovered truth. Broad
in her sympathies with all honest workers, genial
in her manners, remarkably constant and helpful
in her friendships, and withal scholarly to the
backbone in her tastes and ambitions, she stands
out as one of the leading figures of our College.
Two main influences determined her course: first,
that of Professor Creighton, afterwards Bishop of
Peterborough and subsequently Bishop of London,
who came to Cambridge in 1885, and began a new
departure in History of the kind that appealed to
Mary Bateson's mind and character. She became
attached to his family, and he inspired her with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
the ambition which he felt for himself when he
prescribed for his epitaph the words, "He tried to
write true history." After Dr. Creighton's departure
from Cambridge, the teacher from whom she
derived most inspiration and with whom she sometimes
collaborated was the distinguished writer,
Professor F. W. Maitland&mdash;also a most effective
teacher and helper of historical students at Newnham
and in the University generally. Miss Bateson's
researches into <i>Borough Customs</i>, as well as
her previous volumes on the <i>Records of the History
of Leicester</i>, earned her an honourable place among
standard historians of mediaeval institutions, while
her small book on <i>Mediaeval England</i>, and her
admirable account of the "Colonization of Canada"
in the seventh volume of the <i>Cambridge Modern
History</i>, may always be recommended confidently
to the general reader. Mary Bateson was deeply
interested in politics and a strong advocate for
women's suffrage, on behalf of which, in a deputation
to the then Prime Minister (Sir H. Campbell-Bannerman),
she made an exceedingly able and
trenchant speech. But she cared far more that
women should progress in knowledge and capacity
than in political power. The great esteem in which
she had been held was shown in the large attendance
of University men and former students at the
funeral service in St, John's Chapel, and in the
readiness with which the proposal was received, at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
a meeting in St. John's in the following May, of a
memorial to her in Cambridge, which took the
appropriate form of an additional Research Fellowship.
This fellowship bears her name, and is
generally&mdash;<i>ceteris paribus</i>&mdash;given to a former student
engaged in some branch of historical research.</p>

<p>An earlier loss&mdash;happily not so permanent&mdash;was
sustained in 1896 when Miss Gladstone, owing
to the rapidly declining health of her father,
felt bound to resign her College post for family
duties. Miss Gladstone had not only, as already
shown, become a most valuable element in the life
of the College by her geniality and devotion to the
duties she had undertaken. She also, in the eyes
of the world, raised the reputation of the College,
since an institution must be of <i>some</i> significance if
the daughter of one of the most eminent men in
the country, having access to the most brilliant
and interesting society, thought it worth while to
give up&mdash;for most of the year&mdash;the delights of such
an attractive home for the service of a College for
women.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> Miss Gladstone had of late been not only
Vice-Principal (Tutor) in Sidgwick Hall, but
Secretary to the Education Committee, a position
which brought her into constant communication
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
with most of the resident lecturers. In a sense,
the loss could not be entirely repaired, though Miss
Stephen succeeded her as head of Sidgwick Hall.
Miss Stephen had originally come to Newnham as
Secretary to Miss Gladstone, and had become very
popular with the students, especially in helping in
their political debates. She had also, as we have
already said, the charge of the Library, in which
she seemed to know the exact place of every important
book. As she was a daughter of Sir James
Fitzjames Stephen, the distinguished judge, and a
niece of Leslie Stephen (who was induced more than
once to come and give a delightful lecture to the
students), she helped to continue the traditions of
public and intellectual eminence which the students
have always found in the records of their benefactors.
In memory of Miss Gladstone's vice-principalship,
the students raised money to build
an annexe to the dining hall of Sidgwick Hall which,
since the opening of a new wing in 1884, had proved
insufficient for peace and comfort. Another and
important addition to the College was the block
named after others of the founders, Kennedy
Buildings. Now that there were resident fellows
and several research students, it was desirable that
in some part of the College buildings there should
be suites of two rooms, allowing more accommodation
for books and more opportunities for entertaining
than could be easily had in any of the three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
Halls. In 1899, through the remarkable generosity
of several friends, the freehold of the land on which
the College stands was bought.</p>

<p>But meantime, during a period of prosperity,
Newnham had to experience its first serious set-back,
a set-back only paralleled in the week during
which these lines are being written: the Senate
of the University of Cambridge refused a petition
to grant to Girton and Newnham students who had
been successful in the triposes the title of degrees.</p>

<p>The movement had mainly arisen in 1897 to meet
a difficulty springing from the inability of the world
to understand that a certificate stating that a
woman had attained the standard required for a
degree in honours is really as good a guarantee of
attainments as the letters B.A. to which every poll
man is entitled. The handicapping was serious.
At the same time, more definite status was earnestly
desired. The first suggestion of a granting of
degrees was at once dropped. Various compromises
were made by friends and opponents: in
those of the former there was the suggestion of a
titular B.A. and a real M.A. for women&mdash;too
moderate and well reasoned to find many supporters.
Another&mdash;widely taken up, but naturally
unacceptable to all who were intimately and sympathetically
concerned with higher education for
women&mdash;was of a degree-granting University for
women only, called in advance "The Queen's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
University," and styled by Professor Maitland in a
brilliant speech on the other side as "Bletchley
Junction Academy." This would have been even
less of a real University than the original non-teaching
University of London, since that at least
had programmes of study and fixed standards,
whereas the new one was to accept the standards
of existing Universities. It is not certain, however,
whether this impracticable scheme ever came into
anything like definite form.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a id="Fig_7"></a>
  <img src="images/i_123.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="medium center">NEWNHAM COLLEGE, 1920&mdash;GENERAL VIEW.</p>
</div>

<p>The Grace finally proposed by the second Syndicate
appointed for the purpose was as follows:</p>

<p>"The University shall have power to grant by
Diploma, Titles of Degrees in Arts, Law, Science,
Letters, and Music to women who, either before or
after the confirmation of this Statute, have fulfilled
the conditions which shall be required of them for
this purpose by the Ordinances of the University, and
also shall have power to grant by diploma the same
titles <i>honoris causa</i> to women who have not fulfilled
the ordinary conditions, but have been recommended
for such Titles by the Council of the Senate: provided
always that a title granted under this section
shall not involve membership of the University."</p>

<p>It was seen by many opponents and by some
supporters that this Grace, if passed, would not
have been a final settlement. But it would have
removed an undoubted grievance. And in course
of time, when the world had become accustomed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
to women vigorously and successfully engaged in
the administration of colonial and provincial universities,
full membership might have come in later
without much controversy. The most striking
speeches on the women's side were made by the
late master of Trinity (Dr. Butler), Professor Maitland,
Mr. (afterwards Professor) Bateson, and Professor
Sidgwick. The speeches on the other side
generally insisted, without much relevance, on the
limitations of the female mind and the female
physique, the impossibility of women's desire for
University life and learning existing apart from a
wish to copy and rival the other sex, and the like.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
What the mind of Newnham, at its best, thought
on the matter is ably expressed in a flysheet written
by our Secretary, Miss Marion Kennedy, on the eve
of the voting. I quote the later portion: "One
appeal I should like to make to those whom we
still regard as our friends, though for the moment
they are opposed to us. It is that they may not
be led to think that a separate University for
women can be the true solution of the difficulty.</p>

<p>"Can we imagine what the position of such an
institution would really be? If it were merely a
body for conferring degrees without holding examinations,
its degrees must be given alike on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
examinations of Cambridge, Oxford, and Durham;
all the other Universities having opened their
degrees. For the two latter I cannot judge, but
I venture to ask any Cambridge man if he would
care to bear a title which was given indiscriminately
on the examination of his own University and on
those of Oxford and Durham.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>... If, on the
other hand, a Women's University held its own
examinations, its standard could not possibly
command the same respect as those of the older
universities, nor could it give the inspiration which
comes only of ancient tradition. As the Master of
Trinity so well put it in his speech in the Senate
House, generation after generation must be trained
before any such comparison could be possible, and
I fear the time must be measured not only by
generations but by centuries. I think there is no
doubt that if an attempt was made to found a
Women's University, disappointment would be in
store for any who would expect it to lay down a
separate course or courses of study adapted to the
supposed requirements of women. It would on
the contrary be driven to follow the lines of the old
University course even more closely than women
are now required to do, as the only chance of giving
its degrees any practical value. This leads to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
another point on which I think that a few of our
opponents have not treated us quite fairly. It has
been said that women wish to take the Cambridge
course merely because they aim at imitating men.
Surely this assumption is hardly justified by the
facts. May it not be believed that women honestly
seek to share what long experience has decided to
be the best training for the mind?</p>

<p>"It seems to me we are far more likely to allow
fair play to whatever mental differences exist
between men and women by giving them impartially
the best training and affording them every
opportunity to develop their separate powers afterwards,
than if we falsify the result through a diversity
of training which must tend to obscure natural
differences by overlaying them with artificial ones.
I am well aware, however, that when all is said,
differences of opinion will remain, and I only wish
to express, once more, a hope that difference of
opinion need not become intolerance; that however
this question is settled, we shall all be true to
the noble and hitherto unbroken traditions of
Cambridge that by-gones are by-gones, and that
the morrow of a conflict here always finds victors
and vanquished ready to join hands without any
lessening of mutual regard and respect. Nothing
would grieve me more than to have had any share
in so carrying on the discussion as to render this
more difficult.</p>

<p class="smcap right" style="padding-right:2em;">Marion Grace Kennedy."<br /><br /></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>But for the time the voice of "sweet reasonableness"
was drowned in angry clamour. Some
opponents of the College used their influence with
the undergraduates, and especially the athletic
element. Ridiculous stories were set about that
the women intended to press on to admission into
the Colleges. Aged and often very worthy men
who had long been out of touch with the University
but retained the right to vote in its proceedings
flocked up to "save the University" from the
dreaded feminine invasion. Friends of Newnham
and Girton mustered likewise, but the result was
obvious from the beginning. The motion was
defeated by 1713 to 662.</p>

<p>The set-back was felt severely, not so much by
reason of the weight of the adverse vote, as because
of the hostility that had unexpectedly come to the
surface, and the unmannerly way in which, led by
undergraduates' love of a "rag," it was manifested.
Happily, the feelings described by Miss Kennedy
were still characteristic of Cambridge, except in its
worse moments. Next term, when the Newnham
authorities came to discuss the wisdom of asking
lecturers who had taken the opposite part to continue
their permission to women pupils, it was
found that some at least would have been indignant
if not asked to do so.</p>

<p>One good result of the unfortunate conflict
was that it brought the two women's Colleges,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
Newnham and Girton, nearer together. There was
generosity in the yielding by Miss Davies, Dr.
Cunningham, and other notable supporters of
Girton, of points which their Colleges had generally
held with some tenacity. Newnham and Girton
worked hand-in-hand during the conflict and in the
steps by which the mischief done was gradually
repaired.</p>

<p>Happily, since the generations of undergraduates
and women students are short-lived, the episode
became to many as if it had never been. This,
however, was impossible in the case of the members
of the resident staffs. It made, or should
have made, each of them "a sadder and a wiser
man" in future dealings with the University.</p>

<p>Before long Newnham had to suffer a greater
loss, by the death of its protagonist in this and
many other conflicts, as well as its ever-generous
benefactor and friend: Professor Henry Sidgwick.
Something has already been said both as to what
he did and what he resigned for the good of the
College, and yet more might be dwelt on as to the
importance to students and staff of having him
amongst them. Even those who were unable to
appreciate the character of his mind, felt that he
possessed a distinction they had known, if at all,
in very few others. To those who attended his
lectures, read his books, or listened to his talk, he
was felt to excel all others in absolute devotion to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
truth and duty, in breadth of view, in moral and
intellectual patience and forbearance, while this
lofty character was always consistent with a keen
sense of humour, and a human interest in all his
surroundings. He had led an active life, though
always liable to be troubled with insomnia. In
May 1900, his doctor discovered an internal complaint
which required an early operation. The
operation was supposed to be successful, and after
a short time he was able to go for drives and to
enjoy the society of friends. But he was never
deceived as to the nearness of the end, which came
when he was staying with his brother-in-law, Lord
Rayleigh, on August 28th, 1900. As it was mid
vacation there was no funeral service in Trinity or
elsewhere in Cambridge, but one attended by the
family and a few friends in the church at Terling,
in which churchyard he was buried.</p>

<p>It is, as already said, possible for all students to
realize at once the benefits which the College owes
to Sidgwick, and the greatness of his mind and
character, by reading the life written by his wife
and his brother Arthur. Very soon after the
funeral Mrs. Sidgwick returned to Newnham,
and the members of the Staff still in residence
realized that this terrible loss to her did not
involve the loss of her to the College, but that
she would be to it at least all that she had
been before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>A meeting was held soon after to decide how
Professor Sidgwick should be commemorated in
Cambridge. A University lectureship was founded
with the proceeds of a general appeal, and a contribution
to this was made from a special fund
contributed by former students of Newnham; this
fund also provided for an annual Sidgwick Memorial
Lecture at the College. The lecturer has in each case
been appointed by Mrs. Sidgwick, and has generally
so far been some man personally known to Dr. Sidgwick
or interested in some of his own lines of thought.
The first lecture was given by Professor (now
Lord) Bryce in November 1902. His subject was
"Philosophic Life among the Ancients," and many
hearers felt&mdash;as did the lecturer himself&mdash;that the
kind of life he was portraying had in no person
been better exemplified than in Sidgwick himself.
A visitor to Newnham afterwards, standing in the
middle of the garden, quoted as appropriate to
him the epitaph of Wren in St Paul's: <i>Si monumentum
requiris, circumspice</i>. But even that monument
would be insufficient for those who had known
something of his mind and profited by his labours.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V<br />

<span class="st">PROGRESS, 1900-1914</span></h2>


<p>The years which elapsed between the death of
Professor Sidgwick and the retirement of Mrs.
Sidgwick from the principalship at the end of 1910
were marked by progress on various lines. The
increase of demand for accommodation led to the
building of a new Hall, with connecting passages,
at right angles to Clough Hall and Kennedy Buildings,
and facing the Grange Road. This is on
much the same plan as the other Halls, with some
very pleasant common rooms, and accommodation
for another Vice-Principal (Tutor) and two lecturers,
besides about fifty-six students. The central
kitchen, which&mdash;as already stated&mdash;helped greatly
to simplify and otherwise improve the domestic
arrangements, dates from the same time. Peile
Hall was named after Dr. and Mrs. Peile, whose
portraits hang in the dining-hall. Dr. Peile
died on the very day on which the Hall was
opened. It would be difficult to exaggerate
the value of the service rendered to the College<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
by Dr. Peile from its first beginnings till the day
of his death. He was constant in attending
the Council, and was President for many years.
His wisdom in giving advice in difficulties was
equalled by his courage in defending the College in
aspersions and attacks. He had been an intimate
friend of Professor Sidgwick and an eager promoter
of University reform. Mrs. Peile was intensely
interested in everything connected with the College
till the loss of her eyesight and her enfeebled health
withdrew her from her former activities.</p>

<p>Another external addition to the College is the
sunk garden, with fountain, in the lawn immediately
opposite the Memorial Gates. It was paid for as
part of the memorial above mentioned by subscriptions
of students past and present, and the
stone margin has for legend: "The daughters of
this house to those that shall come after commend
the filial remembrance of Henry Sidgwick."</p>

<p>No further steps towards a request for degrees
was made for many years after the rebuff in 1897,
but in the spring of 1904 a recognition of the status
of Tripos students came from an unexpected quarter&mdash;the
University of Dublin. There had been a
party favourable to women graduates in Dublin,
and the Royal University of Ireland already granted
degrees to those women who had passed its
examinations, among whom were the students of
Alexandra College, the head of which had herself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
been a Newnham student. After the death of a
very highly respected but also very conservative
Provost the authorities of Trinity College admitted
women to their degrees, and at the same time
offered an <i>ad eundem</i> degree to all women who had
passed examinations qualifying for a degree at
Oxford or Cambridge. Trinity College already
granted the <i>ad eundem</i> degree to graduates of
Oxford and Cambridge, and this new step amounted
to the recognition of the Tripos certificate granted
to women at Cambridge as the equivalent of a
degree. The result was perhaps surprising to its
originators, but not to those who really understood
one of the reasons why women students at Oxford
and Cambridge had asked for degrees. Numbers of
young women trooped over as soon as possible after
the results of their tripos were known, to take
the B.A. degree. Many others who if degrees
at Cambridge had been open to them would
have been of M.A. standing took B.A. and M.A.
both at Dublin. A few, whose literary or scientific
work had made them worthy of a doctorate, were
admitted to the higher degree. The Dublin officials
were apparently somewhat surprised and puzzled.
They generously applied most of the money raised
by fees to the establishment of a Hall of residence
for women students in Dublin.</p>

<p>This privilege was open to Oxford and Cambridge
women for a few years only, since the object which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
the authorities of Trinity College, Dublin, had in
view was to provide for those women who had
begun or completed their courses elsewhere and
could therefore not make use of the opportunities
which the College now offered to women. One
great advantage, however, had been derived by the
general cause from the temporary grant of Dublin:
it had been made clear that the degree of a respected
University was, for women, really worth
having. Busy women of moderate means do not
take long journeys and pay considerable fees (£10
for the B.A. and £20 for the M.A.) for a merely
fanciful advantage. Nor would the City Companies,
which had granted certain scholarships to
Newnham students, have been willing to pay, as they
did, the fees for their scholars' Dublin degrees unless
they felt sure that these would be to such scholars'
advantage. A good many head mistresses felt it
an advantage to be able to wear gown and hood,
especially when some of their assistants could
already wear the academic dress of London or of
a Scotch or Welsh University. London did not
grant its degrees to Cambridge women without
some further test, though it admitted those who
had taken Triposes to send in theses for a research
M.A. degree without the actual B.A. degree required
in men students. The only women who
might have taken the Dublin degree, and had not
much reason or inclination to do so, were members
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
of the Newnham Staff, whose position was well
understood by those around them. If, however,
they migrated during the time that the Dublin <i>ad
eundem</i> was open to them, they sometimes found it
desirable to take it.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a id="Fig_8"></a>
  <img src="images/i_137.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="medium center">MISS KATHARINE STEPHEN.</p>
</div>

<p>Mrs. Sidgwick's principalship came to an end in
December 1910. Though Staff and students very
deeply deplored her withdrawal, it was felt that
she was more than entitled to more leisure for
scientific pursuits, family enjoyments, and greater
liberty generally. She was not lost altogether to
Newnham, since she retained for several years the
post of Treasurer (afterwards called <i>Bursar</i>), and
after Dr. Peile's death she consented to become
President of the Newnham College Council. The
principalship was offered to Miss Katharine Stephen,
who accepted it and held it for nearly ten years.
Mrs. Sidgwick moved into a house separated from
Peile Hall by the Grange Road only, and thus was
easily in touch with College affairs.</p>

<p>One more improvement&mdash;and a very important
one&mdash;was made before Mrs. Sidgwick's retirement:
the determination of a fixed age for retirement
for the Staff and of a pension to follow. The
salaries of all the lecturers were raised and standardized.
In the early days the pay had been
low, even according to the standard of that time,
simply because Newnham had not the funds at its
disposal that better endowed Colleges possessed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
Still, as we have seen, a great deal had been done
for the promotion of learning and research, and
some of the lecturers had from time to time benefited
by the endowments for this purpose. But by the
arrangements which came into force in 1910 the
whole status and earnings of the Staff were revised,
and a contributory pension scheme initiated, with
a liberal provision for making the advantages of
the scheme retrospective in the case of lecturers of
some years' standing.</p>

<p>Shortly after these reforms, others on a larger
scale were projected, and in a few years successfully
accomplished. It was considered by some past
students that the Constitution of the College,
though it had worked well, was more fitted for the
infancy of such an institution than for its adult
life. The subject was naturally one taken up and
discussed by the Associates at their annual meeting.
Some Associates who were connected with one or
other of the provincial Universities were anxious to
introduce changes which would more or less assimilate
Newnham to such Universities. Others held
that whatever changes were made ought to be
rather on a College than a University plan, and
that the wisest course would be to make Newnham,
in general government and arrangements, sufficiently
like the Cambridge Colleges for it to be
able, if ever the happy day arose of its full recognition
by the University, to fall into line and take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
its place with the other Colleges. The Associates
chose a committee from among themselves to draft
a scheme, and to them were joined representatives
of the Council, including experienced members
of the University, who gave invaluable help, and
the results they came to were successful in meeting
with a unanimous acceptance. The models
chosen were chiefly the smaller Colleges, but none
were followed slavishly, and the scheme when it
emerged was found acceptable to the whole body
of Associates. The Council on this, as on similar
occasions, was not above taking suggestions from
the past students and working on the lines thrown
out. The result was a petition for a Charter which,
with the Statutes of the College, became operative
in the year 1917.</p>

<p>The main object of the Charter was to constitute
"one body politic and corporate by the name and
style of 'the Principal and Fellows of Newnham
College'" with perpetual succession, a common
seal, power to sue and be sued in court, to hold
and dispose of property and the like. Its chief
objects were defined as: "(<i>b</i>) to establish and
maintain at or near Cambridge a house or residence
or houses or residences in which female students
may reside and study; (<i>c</i>) to provide a liberal
education for women by carrying on the work of
the old Association with such modifications as may
from time to time appear desirable either in its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
present situation or elsewhere in the town of Cambridge
or County of Cambridge; (<i>f</i>) to do all such
other things as are incidental or conducive to
advancing education and learning among women
in Cambridge and elsewhere."</p>

<p>One point with regard to the new Charter and
Statutes requires notice, viz. the use of the name
Fellow as applied to a member of "the one body
politic and corporate." Hitherto the title of Fellow
had been attached to the endowment for research
for which funds had been collected as already
mentioned. The word Fellow in the Cambridge
Colleges had always connoted membership of a
corporate body, but as Fellows of Colleges were in
general chosen for academic eminence or promise
the name was associated with the expectation of
services in the advancement of learning and research.
This association with the title had influenced
the first champions of research for women,
and in addition they desired that these endowments
should be used by women of high standing and
proved capacity in the sphere of learning to whom
the status of Fellow rather than that of Research
Student was due.</p>

<p>But when under the new Charter the constitution
of Newnham was to some extent assimilated to
those of the older Colleges, it seemed desirable that
members of the new Governing Body should have
the name which in Cambridge is associated with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
these functions. Therefore the name Fellow was
given to members of the Governing Body, and that
of Research Fellow to those who hold one of the
special endowments for research. By the provisions
of the Charter some of the Research Fellows
must always be members of the Governing Body
and therefore also Fellows.</p>

<p>To return to the government of the College as
revised and established by the Charter:</p>

<p>The ultimate authority in the affairs of the
College is the Governing Body. This comprises all
full members of the Staff, a fixed number of Research
Fellows chosen by the Governing Body;
representatives of the Associates,<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> and certain
"Founders and Benefactors" living at the date of
the Charter. The Council is a smaller body, and
comprises besides the Principal, the Vice-Principal,
the Bursar, and one of the Tutors, three members
of the Senate of the University, elected by the
Governing Body, seven additional members of the
Governing Body, and three Founders and Benefactors
alive in 1917.</p>

<p>Several points in the Charter will attract the
attention of any student of former times who may
be reading this history. The changes in nomenclature
are, at first sight, puzzling. The use of the
term <i>Fellow</i> has, as the most important, already
been dwelt upon: that of <i>Tutor</i> as supplanting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
<i>Vice-Principal</i> has also been noticed. There is now
but <i>one</i> Vice-Principal, the numerous and important
duties associated with the former vice-principalship
being discharged by the Tutors superintending each
Hall respectively. The Vice-Principal has now the
functions properly assigned to the title, since she
is bound to take the place of the Principal on necessary
occasions, and especially to be in residence in
the College when the Principal is absent (except in
vacations). The term <i>Bursar</i> replaces that of
<i>Treasurer</i>.</p>

<p>There is something of the nature of representative
government in the election of Associate
members on the Governing Body. The general
body of past students has recognition in that the
Statutes provide for the maintenance of a Newnham
College Roll. The compiling and keeping up of
this Roll has involved considerable labour on the
part of the first registrar chosen to that office, Miss
Edith Sharpley. It has, as already said, succeeded
to the "Newnham College Club," but
has recognised status. It now numbers a large
proportion of former students, and the College may
confidently look to them to further its interests and
usefulness in all parts of the world.</p>

<p>Like the other Colleges, Newnham now has a
Visitor, and the first Visitors have been two successive
Chancellors of the University of Cambridge,
Lord Rayleigh and the Rt. Hon. A. J. Balfour,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
respectively brother-in-law and brother of Mrs.
Sidgwick.</p>

<p>Another feature in the new Constitution that will
strike past students is the smaller proportion
than formerly of members of the University compared
to the Newnham College officials. It must
not, however, be for a moment supposed that the
College is not and will not continue to be in many
ways dependent on the changes and general progress
of the University. It will still be practically
unable to take any important steps without the
advice of some members of the University who are
friendly to the College and its Staff. There will
always be members of the Senate on the Council of
Newnham College, and for some years, it is hoped,
on the Governing Body. But beyond actual membership
in any body concerned in the government
of the College, Newnham must always hope to
retain and even to increase the number of Cambridge
dons and teachers interested both in its
students, who may be their pupils, and in its lecturers,
whom they regard as colleagues. In considerations
of this kind, law can only create and
maintain possible relations. The actual relations
will, we trust, become modified as time goes on,
and this, even in spite of temporary drawbacks, in
the direction of closer co-operation and mutual
respect between the men's and the women's Colleges
in work and in other helpful intercourse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>From some provisions in the Charter, and from
the general progress which has been traced, it must
appear that the body of residents of graduate
standing in Newnham, including administrative
officials, lecturers, and Research Students and
Fellows, had for years been growing in importance
and developing a corporate life. Junior to the
Staff and Research Fellows, but of post-graduate
standing, are those who hold the two or three
research studentships which have been mentioned,
and of late years others who have completed the
degree courses have been enabled to stay on in
Cambridge and carry on work in the laboratories
by grants from the Medical Research Council and
the Industrial Research Board. Of late, too,
students with degrees from overseas and from
other British Universities have come to Cambridge
in increasing numbers to work for the recently
established Research Certificates of the University.
These students, with their wider interests and
experience doing specialized advanced work in
various subjects literary and scientific, some of
them resident in the College, others living outside
but connected with it, add a valuable element and
form a link between the generations.</p>

<p>Old students are encouraged to come up to read
in the Long Vacation, and thus keep up their old
friendships and renew their old interests. Sometimes,
it is true, Newnham is almost too full, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
visitors from outside, to afford the peaceful time
for uninterrupted and independent work characteristic
of the "Longs" of former days. Yet the
visits of distant friends is often stimulating as well
as pleasant. Almost every other year, since the
University Extension Summer Meetings began&mdash;we
may almost say at Newnham's initiative<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>&mdash;some
of the students have been accommodated in Newnham.
This is true, too, of the Vacation Terms for
Biblical Study; since those were inaugurated by
Mrs. Sidgwick's niece, Miss Margaret Benson, and
intended chiefly as a help to school teachers, the
promoters naturally looked to Newnham for hospitality,
and many old students attend the courses.
Learned societies of mathematicians, historians
and others have often come to England from
all over the world, and Newnham has been glad
to entertain both learned ladies and the wives
of learned men staying in the Colleges. Another
kind of gathering may be mentioned, as
somewhat original in idea and very useful in practice.
Several of the students of Natural Science
who, after taking their Tripos, had gone to teach
in schools, complained of the scarcity and inferiority
of the apparatus at their disposal. The lecturer in
Chemical Science, Miss Ida Freund, arranged that
a company of them should come to Cambridge for
a part of the Long Vacation to learn how to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
construct the simpler kind of instruments for themselves.
The result was very satisfactory, and the
teachers learned not only how to make the best of
the conditions under which they might have to
teach, but also how to keep abreast of the progress
of the Natural Sciences and of the methods of
teaching them. It seemed natural that on Miss
Freund's lamented death in 1914 the Memorial
to her should take the form of a brief course
of lectures by an experienced teacher on the
teaching of Physics. The summer meetings, at
which these lectures were delivered, helped to keep
teachers from falling behind in the general progress
of knowledge and also to guide them in the practical
work of education.</p>

<p>One very large part of the story of Newnham has
been as yet little or incidentally treated in this
history; the development of student life and
interests. At the beginning that was practically
the whole life of the community: there were no
dons, and the Principal (without losing separate
and family interests) merged her life in that of the
young people who were under her care. Things
were bound to develop in both expected and unexpected
ways. As more and more students came
to College, variety increased, and at the same time
College was likely to become more like a continuation
of school. It would perhaps be impossible to
trace quite accurately any particular tone or character<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
or even standard of ability rising and falling
in the annals of the Newnham students. At first,
as already suggested, there was sure to be something
of originality and enterprise. Girls were
never sent to College as a matter of course,
and in many cases they had had hard work in
persuading their parents to let them come even
for a slight taste of College life. Certainly some
came for a short spell and remained for many years,
though the fact of coming up without any definite
intentions often worked havoc with chances of
academic success. There were generally cultivated
adult women grappling with subjects which they
ought to have mastered in childhood; and also
very young students striving after knowledge of a
kind beyond their present reach. Possibly these
aberrations made student life more interesting.
But they could not fail to be diminished&mdash;though
not even now eliminated&mdash;with the growth of a
more uniform standard in the curriculum of girls'
schools.</p>

<p>The oldest student society was the Debating
Society. It is said to have had its first meetings
under the medlar tree in Merton Hall garden. Its
rules were reduced to writing in the late seventies,
though subjected later to much revision. Its
history&mdash;like all histories&mdash;would, if written, show
great fluctuations in energy, popularity, and
capacity. In the early days there was quite enough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
earnestness and desire to convince the world&mdash;the
Newnham world that is&mdash;of the truth or falsity of
certain propositions, political, moral or social.
I believe that the good rule against reading
speeches was generally adhered to, but it was
sometimes avoided by the speech having been
learned by heart, and having thereby lost spontaneity
without acquiring the possible merits of a
careful essay. The early generations of students
were very kind and tolerant to wearisome speakers,
though the time rule was strictly adhered to. The
fatal fault of most debating societies&mdash;the desire to
be humorous rather than convincing&mdash;threatened at
times to destroy both qualities. But from time to
time, capable speakers who really had something
to say arose to retrieve the character of the Society.
In 1884 it suffered somewhat by the creation of
another society, which became almost co-extensive
with the College, for discussing political questions.
The original Debating Society did not preclude
itself from politics, but it naturally left them to
the other society, and was apt to descend to what was
somewhat trivial or else took refuge in the paradoxical.
Its temporary declines, however, were, as
just said, generally followed by reinvigoration.
Meantime the Political Debating Society, which
met weekly (for the space of one hour only), kept
up a very lively interest in public affairs, and also
gave more practice in ready impromptu speaking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
than was possible in the general College debates.
It adopted all the forms of an imitation House of
Commons, with Speaker, Government, Opposition,
and the like. Some older critics were only in part
sympathetic, considering that the association of
public interests with party disputes was detrimental
to the formation of unprejudiced opinions. On the
whole, however, the great advantage was secured
of keeping a large number of students <i>au fait</i> with
the chief political questions of the day. Additional
instructiveness and liveliness were imparted by the
fact that students whose fathers or friends were in
Parliament occasionally "coached them up" in
arguments and prognostications. The society became
slack after many years, owing, I think, to the
excessive burden thrown on a few students who
were responsible for preparing the weekly business,
and was reorganized with the forms of an ordinary
debating society. It was suspended during the
War, but revived&mdash;as society, not as amateur
parliament&mdash;after the Armistice. It has since resumed
the parliamentary form.</p>

<p>Besides the debating societies, each subject or
group of subjects has for many years had its
meetings for reading and discussing papers on
Classical, Scientific, Historical, and many other
subjects. Not infrequently some distinguished
man or woman from outside has been invited to
deliver a lecture.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>The Choral Society began in the earlier days of
Newnham, and long enjoyed the devoted and very
able direction of Dr. Mann, Organist of King's
College, and gave very successful concerts. The
display of musical talent in the College is anything
but uniform. One year we had a good orchestra
of stringed instruments, and the same may occur
again from time to time. Meanwhile, a musical
society, started in a much humbler way by an
industrious student who was desirous of "keeping
up her practice" and inducing fellow students to
do the same and be ready to play some piece to one
another on Saturdays, has developed into a considerable
College club called after its foundress,
The Raleigh Musical Society. A good many
students, too, have been members of the Cambridge
University Musical Society.</p>

<p>Astronomical interests have been cultivated in
non-mathematical students since the valuable gift
of a telescope and small observatory by Mrs. Boreham
(daughter-in-law of the astronomer) in 1891.
It was at first placed on a mound to the south of
Clough Hall, but when the view from it was
obstructed by the building of Peile Hall it was
removed to an open space at the far end of the
College grounds. It was placed under the curatorship
of a mathematical scholar who had not only
been a high wrangler, but had had the advantage
of having been brought up in an astronomical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
atmosphere, Miss E. A. Stoney. Students with no
knowledge of astronomy were invited on certain
evenings to see Saturn's rings and Jupiter's moons.
Their interest was attracted even to things of the
heavens which are visible to the naked eye. There
was an enthusiasm for "learning the constellations,"
instruction being given by the expert to the ignorant.
One night, when one of the mathematical lecturers
informed the students that the phenomenon was
about to take place described as "the Moon swallowing
Jupiter," a large number of students assembled
on the lawn to watch the event. Happily it occurred
about 9 p.m. on a clear night. The act of swallowing
was greeted by a cheer&mdash;though whether the
object cheered was Jupiter, the Moon, or the lecturer
who had given warning was not very clear.
This little event is mentioned as one of the many
cases in which the common life of students engaged
in heterogeneous subjects has advantages of an
educational as well as of a social kind.</p>

<p>We have already mentioned the lectures on
Literature which were at one time given by first-rate
men of letters to students of all faculties four
or five times a year. Attendance at them was
never compulsory, but the interest of the subject
and distinction of the lecturer attracted many,
and this continued to be the case with the
Sidgwick Memorial Lecture. A student of natural
science has expressed her deep debt to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
attraction to good literature which these lectures
afforded. Latterly the lectures given by holders of
the new professorship of English (Dr. Verrall and
Sir A. Quiller Couch), which are open to other than
special students of the subject, amply provided for
the objects aimed at in the earlier Newnham
lectures.</p>

<p>Naturally the societies or clubs that loom largest
in the life of present and the memories of past
students are those connected with games. Hockey,
as already said, was started by the first Principal
herself, and it has remained for a long time one of
the most prominent of the games societies. The
several Halls have their teams, and play against
one another; the College team plays against Girton
and more distant colleges and schools as well as
other clubs; also matches are played between past
and present students. Fives is provided for by
good courts. Cricket is played in the summer
term. Tennis had been with us from the beginning
of Lawn Tennis itself, and ash courts made
the game possible all the year round. Lacrosse
was introduced a good deal later. The introduction
of bicycling during the middle nineties furnished
a new mode of exercise and stimulated exploration
of the country.</p>

<p>There have been, of course, many smaller
societies: Sharp Practice, to make students ready
in debate; boating, which has recently arrived at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
having an eight of its own; others of names incomprehensible
to any but the initiated. In connection
with the Women's Settlement in Southwark, there
has from its beginning been a society following its
progress and contributing to its funds. The visits
of Residents in the Settlement to explain to the
students their work or some branch of it have been
very interesting occasions&mdash;especially in the days
when Miss Gladstone was Warden, and came to
give a humorous account of her experiences, professedly
to the first-year students, practically to as
many of the students and staff as could crowd into
the room.</p>

<p>Although there has not been till lately a formal
dramatic society, any dramatic talent among the
students has generally revealed itself fairly soon.
The excuse of some worthy object to be served by
threepenny tickets has been made the occasion of
extremely lively impromptu performances. Especially
the gift for melodrama has been displayed with
success and has often caused intense amusement.
More serious plays, or scenes from plays, have been
exhibited from time to time, but those have been
most successful which had the least elaborate preparation.
It may be mentioned that Newnham
students have taken part in serious dramatic performances
organized by members of the University;
as in the <i>Comus</i>, acted on the occasion of the Miltonic
Tercentenary.</p>

<p>In other fields there has been collective activity
among Newnham students. There have been
various religious societies, in most of which Newnham
students are combined with those of Girton
and other Colleges. In Newnham itself there have
been societies for reading and discussing religious
and moral questions on Sunday evenings, the
subjects being sometimes theoretical, sometimes
practical. There has been a branch of a Church
Society called "The Society of the Annunciation,"
which had corporate Communion with Girton and
some religious addresses in a Cambridge church.
But far the largest and most influential is the
<i>Student Christian Movement</i>, which has arisen from
small beginnings and now has vigorous branches all
over the world. Connected with this there has
always been a collective and particular effort
towards missionary work. A good many Newnham
students became Student Volunteers, and some are
doing excellent work abroad, especially in schools
and Colleges of a new type, requiring higher education,
and in medical practice. But the operation of
the whole movement is too well known to need
description here. It has branched out into new
departments, and has changed both its qualifications
for membership and its relations to religious
bodies at home and abroad, so as to become a far
more potent agency than formerly in all Colleges
and among varied types of student. Some of its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
leaders are frequently in Cambridge, and are cordially
received at Newnham as well as in the Cambridge
Colleges generally.</p>

<p>With regard to students and the political world.
There had been a Suffrage Society in the College
from comparatively early times. It has already
been noticed how there had been among the early
promoters of higher education for women a good
many who set great hopes on the improvement of
the position of women as citizens, and especially on
their acquisition of the parliamentary vote. There
were, however, among Staff and students of Newnham,
several who felt much disgusted with the
lawlessness and general want of reason and sobriety
with which, in some quarters, the political cause of
women was associated. A few, on the other
hand, though not among those in authority, were
inclined to go great lengths against the injustice
and levity with which the whole question was
treated by Parliament and by the Government.
Those who desired and believed in the suffrage, but
strongly disapproved of the violent and illegal actions
of the extreme wing, took an active part in the
orderly demonstrations organised by the law-abiding
section of the movement. Thus members of the
Staff and of the student body walked in the London
processions and took part in the "Pilgrimage" of
June 1912. A very small number of former students
carried their principles to the extreme and suffered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
in consequence. But the attitude in general of
Newnham in the whole matter was one of decided
conviction, combined with patience and moderation.</p>

<p>Perhaps a few words should be said here as to the
changes which were made, or gradually came about,
in the necessary rules for student life and behaviour.
It must always be remembered that fifty years ago,
both unreasoned etiquette and the opinions of
reasonable men and women recognised much severer
rules for the general conduct of young women than
are in force to-day; also that in Cambridge, so
much a city of men, the standard of conventional
propriety for women was stricter than in most other
places. Miss Clough and her fellow workers in the
early times were sometimes obliged, for the sake of
security against prejudice and gossip, to walk very
warily, always, however, avoiding the imposition of
such restraints as would have impeded either good
work or the enjoyment of good health. It has been
seen how Miss Clough herself undertook the sometimes
weary duty of chaperoning and minimized its
inconvenience, and in little restrictions of a social
kind she tried to impress on the early students
that they were guests of the University and also
pioneers who might by their own behaviour improve
or spoil the chances of more liberty for those who
should come after. As time went on, many rules
were relaxed, and those that now have to be
observed are laid down with the utmost care by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
the authorities, special regard being paid to the
opinions and counsel of those who have to maintain
order and discipline in the University and the
Colleges.</p>

<p>The students themselves have never been discouraged
from presenting to the heads of their
separate Halls or to the Principal any suggestions
as to possible modifications in domestic arrangement
or in general regulations. Machinery for this
purpose has been devised and modified from time
to time. The students in residence choose (since
1911) a Senior Student, and it is one of her
duties to communicate their views to the authorities.
A joint committee of staff and students
deliberates upon proposed alterations. There is
also a Hall senior student elected by each Hall
separately. It is generally recognised that great
care is still required in forbidding or sanctioning
matters which to a newcomer seem much more
simple than they really are. The past prosperity
of the College has been in very great part due to a
good understanding between governors and governed,
and this is still, in a sense, to be regarded as the
sheet anchor of the College in Cambridge. It
seems to be recognised in the Colleges of the University
that the only way to avoid excessive ebullitions
of youthful spirit is to enlist on the side of law and
order some popular and leading spirits among the
undergraduates themselves. The same principle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
applies in women's Colleges, where the students, as
a rule (like public schoolboys), have learned, in
pre-college days, the necessity of rules and regularity.
If Newnham ever becomes a College of the
University, the students will, of course, be subjected
to proctorial discipline, but the process would
probably be found not to involve any conspicuous
changes in College life.</p>

<h2>EPILOGUE<br />

<span class="st">1914 AND AFTER</span></h2>


<p>The outbreak of the Great War marks an epoch in
the history of Newnham as of other institutions at
home and abroad. Its experience confirms also the
commonly repeated statement that in many things
the results of the war have proved very different from
those anticipated either in the event of success or
of failure. One consequence confidently anticipated
was at least temporary decline. We were bound to
suffer restrictions and something of poverty, for the
first item in which the so-called practical man and
woman economize is education. Yet we all see at
this moment that in spite of fiscal difficulties in
public and losses in private affairs, all our schools
and colleges are full to overflowing. Newnham
participates in this experience, and is compelled to
refuse promise of admission to many qualified and
promising students. The reasons for this surprising
fact are to be found partly in government policy,
partly in economic causes still awaiting elucidation;
possibly also in a genuine belief in education as a
good thing for women as for men.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>One danger is to be apprehended: the lack of
really well-prepared students, owing to the comparative
scarcity of able University women who
enter the teaching profession. Yet while these
words are being written, the course of events may
take an opposite trend. The salaries of mistresses
in schools are raised to an unprecedented height,
if perhaps hardly more than is required to cover
increased cost of living. And the young women
who have been serving the country in administrative
work or directing their energies to the land or to
domestic productiveness may, in course of time,
find their way back to the task of teaching, which,
after all, has inspired a genuine enthusiasm in many
of our leaders. Early in the War, when some
students were feeling doubts whether patriotic duty
might not bid them give up their academic course
for labour of a directly useful kind, the Right Hon.
H. A. L. Fisher gave in Cambridge a convincing
address as to the necessity of keeping up educational
and academic work with a view to the requirements
of the future.</p>

<p>Any even slight account of what Newnham
students of past days did during the War would
seem to be out of place here in that they did it as
individuals, not as a College.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> Collectively, however,
they furnished, along with Girton, a hospital
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
unit which did excellent work in Belgium, France
and Serbia, and later in Salonika. This unit was
organized under Scottish management by the Union
of Suffrage Societies, but there was, of course, no
political aim in its operations.</p>

<p>Past students of Newnham were engaged in War
Hospitals in many places. At the same time some
of the most competent Newnham mathematicians
were employed in making calculations to assist in
the construction of aeroplanes. A multitude undertook
work in helping soldiers' families, providing
necessaries for hospitals, and housing refugees;
while others went in companies to gather in fruit
and do other work on the land. In London so
many were engaged in government offices that a
past student in London in the summer of 1917,
meeting College friends at every turn, would salute
each fresh face with: "What department are you
in?" Many took temporary posts in Universities
and boys' schools. Those who remained in Cambridge
had much to do in teaching English to
Belgians, Serbians and other refugees, and in
visiting wounded soldiers in the First Eastern and
other Hospitals.</p>

<p>The result of all this activity along unexpectedly
opened lines cannot yet be estimated. Certainly
proof was given of the efficiency of educated women
in carrying on work that had never been open to
them before. In some regions (<i>e.g.</i> that of police<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
work) it has been agreed upon that even in normal
times it is highly desirable that some women should
be employed. The issue must be awaited in
patience.</p>

<p>It would, of course, be unworthy of the College
to suppose that in their activities these women
were moved by a wish to better their position and
that of their College. Common humanity and
genuine patriotism were at the bottom of their
efforts. But doubtless the capacity and energy
which they displayed helped indirectly towards the
grant of the Suffrage. It is a very notable thing
that when the Suffrage came, past students of
Newnham and Girton of the qualified age, who
had the "equivalent of a degree," were adjudged
capable of using the parliamentary vote for the
University of Cambridge. Parliament was, however,
not so liberal as Dublin had been, as it did not
recognise as "equivalent" the Tripos Certificates
given before the Graces of 1881.</p>

<p>One more change awaited the College at the end
of the last academic year, in the retirement of the
Principal, Miss Katharine Stephen, a loss much
deplored, though Miss Stephen retains her seat on
the Council. Her devotion to the work she had
undertaken, and the ability with which she discharged
it need no eulogies here. Happily, her
place has been filled by the niece and biographer of
the First Principal. Miss B. A. Clough has not only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
spent many years within the College precincts and
watched its continuous progress, with occasional
drawbacks, from comparatively early days; she
has also been intimately associated with its pioneers
and has acquired an unrivalled knowledge of the
aspirations and the needs of student life. As, in
old times, the rule of a Foundress Abbess seemed
sometimes to be best carried on by a niece who had
lived much in her environment, so we may hope
good things in future from the fact that our Principal
is in more than name the honoured successor of
Anne Jemima Clough.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a id="Fig_9"></a>
  <img src="images/i_165.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="medium center">MISS B. A. CLOUGH.</p>
</div>

<p>As these chapters were being written, the struggle
was again begun for membership in the University
of Cambridge, and&mdash;as we know only too well&mdash;the
result was a failure, though not so crushing a failure
as the attempt in 1897 when the demands were far
more modest. It is not desirable to dwell on this
event, but we hope we may accept the assurance of
many friends that it cannot be long before we
obtain what we are asking. Meanwhile we may
console ourselves by thinking that the Women's
Colleges have earned the respect even of opponents,
and that there is no probability of their
being deprived of the privileges which they still
enjoy. It would be unwise to pretend indifference
to our defeat. Yet we have full reason
to celebrate our Jubilee in joy and hope. For,
after all, the treasure to seek which our pioneers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
came to Cambridge fifty years ago, is in our possession
and likely to remain with us permanently.
That treasure is Education: the opportunity of
learning from the best teachers; of co-operation
with like-minded learners; the opening up of
opportunities of learning more of nature and of
man; fitness for doing whatever tasks the future
may offer to those who seek, like our first benefactors,
a life of active and intelligent service.
That was their ideal and it may well continue
to be ours.</p>

movement, was throughout her life collaborating with great

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
